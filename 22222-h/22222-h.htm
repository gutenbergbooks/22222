<h2>HOW TO WRITE LETTERS</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2><a name="chap_1" id="chap_1"></a>WHAT IS A LETTER?</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It is</span> not so long since most personal letters, after an extremely formal
salutation, began "I take my pen in hand." We do not see that so much
nowadays, but the spirit lingers. Pick up the average letter and you
cannot fail to discover that the writer has grimly taken his pen in hand
and, filled with one thought, has attacked the paper. That one thought
is to get the thing over with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p><p>And perhaps this attitude of getting the thing over with at all costs is
not so bad after all. There are those who lament the passing of the
ceremonious letter and others who regret that the "literary" letter&mdash;the
kind of letter that can be published&mdash;is no longer with us. But the old
letter of ceremony was not really more useful than a powdered wig, and
as for the sort of letter that delights the heart and lightens the labor
of the biographer&mdash;well, that is still being written by the kind of
person who can write it. It is better that a letter should be written
because the writer has something to say than as a token of culture.
Some of the letters of our dead great do too often remind us that they
were not forgetful of posterity.</p>

<p>The average writer of a letter might well forget culture and posterity
and address himself to the task in hand, which, in other than the most
exceptional sort of letter, is to say what he has to say in the shortest
possible compass that will serve to convey the thought or the
information that he wants to hand on. For a letter is a conveyance of
thought; if it becomes a medium of expression it is less a letter than a
diary fragment.</p>

<p>Most of our letters in these days relate to business affairs or to
social affairs that, as far as personality is concerned, might as well
be business. Our average letter has a rather narrow objective and is not
designed to be literature. We may, it is true, write to cheer up a sick
friend, we may write to tell about what we are doing, we may write that
sort of missive which can be classified only as a love letter&mdash;but
unless such letters come naturally it is better that they be not
written. They are the exceptional letters. It is absurd to write them
according to rule. In fact, it is absurd to write any letter according
to rule. But one can learn the best usage in correspondence, and that is
all that this book attempts to present.</p>

<p>The heyday of letter writing was in the eighteenth century in England.
George Saintsbury, in his interesting "A Letter Book," says:</p>

<p class="quote s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>"By common consent of all opinion worth attention that century was, in
the two European literatures which were equally free from crudity and
decadence&mdash;French and English&mdash;the very palmiest day of the art.
Everybody wrote letters, and a surprising number of people wrote letters
well. Our own three most famous epistolers of the male sex, Horace
Walpole, Gray, and Cowper&mdash;belong wholly to it; and 'Lady Mary'&mdash;our
most famous she-ditto&mdash;belongs to it by all but her childhood; as does
Chesterfield, whom some not bad judges would put not far if at all below
the three men just mentioned. The rise of the novel in this century is
hardly more remarkable than the way in which that novel almost wedded
itself&mdash;certainly joined itself in the most frequent friendship&mdash;to the
letter-form. But perhaps the excellence of the choicer examples in this
time is not really more important than the abundance, variety, and
popularity of its letters, whether good, indifferent, or bad. To use one
of the informal superlatives sanctioned by familiar custom it was the
'letter-writingest' of ages from almost every point of view. In its
least as in its most dignified moods it even overflowed into verse if
not into poetry as a medium. Serious epistles had&mdash;of course on
classical models&mdash;been written in verse for a long time. But now in
England more modern patterns, and especially Anstey's <em>New Bath Guide</em>,
started the fashion of actual correspondence in doggerel verse with no
thought of print&mdash;a practice in which persons as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>different as Madame
d'Arblay's good-natured but rather foolish father, and a poet and
historian like Southey indulged; and which did not become obsolete till
Victorian times, if then."</p>

<p>There is a wide distinction between a letter and an epistle. The letter
is a substitute for a spoken conversation. It is spontaneous, private,
and personal. It is non-literary and is not written for the eyes of the
general public. The epistle is in the way of being a public speech&mdash;an
audience is in mind. It is written with a view to permanence. The
relation between an epistle and a letter has been compared to that
between a Platonic dialogue and a talk between two friends. A great
man's letters, on account of their value in setting forth the views of a
school or a person, may, if produced after his death, become epistles.
Some of these, genuine or forgeries, under some eminent name, have come
down to us from the days of the early Roman Empire. Cicero, Plato,
Aristotle, Demosthenes, are the principal names to which these epistles,
genuine and pseudonymous, are attached.</p>

<p>Some of the letters of Cicero are rather epistles, as they were intended
for the general reader.</p>

<p>The ancient world&mdash;Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, Rome, and Greece&mdash;figures
in our inheritance of letters. In Egypt have been discovered genuine
letters. The papyrus discoveries contain letters of unknowns who had no
thought of being read by the general public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>During the Renaissance, Cicero's letters were used as models for one of
the most common forms of literary effort. There is a whole literature of
epistles from Petrarch to the <em>Epistol&aelig; obscurorum virorum</em>. These are,
to some degree, similar to the Epistles of Martin Marprelate.</p>

<p>Later epistolary satires are Pascal's "Provincial Letters," Swift's
"Drapier Letters," and the "Letters of Junius."</p>

<p>Pope, soon to be followed by Lady Mary Montagu, was the first Englishman
who treated letter writing as an art upon a considerable scale.</p>

<p>Modern journalism uses a form known as the "open letter" which is really
an epistle.</p>

<p>But we are not here concerned with the letter as literature.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2><a name="chap_2" id="chap_2"></a>THE PURPOSE OF THE LETTER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No one</span> can go far wrong in writing any sort of letter if first the
trouble be taken to set out the exact object of the letter. A letter
always has an object&mdash;otherwise why write it? But somehow, and
particularly in the dictated letter, the object frequently gets lost in
the words. A handwritten letter is not so apt to be wordy&mdash;it is too
much trouble to write. But a man dictating may, especially if he be
interrupted by telephone calls, ramble all around what he wants to say
and in the end have used two pages for what ought to have been said in
three lines. On the other hand, letters may be so brief as to produce an
impression of abrupt discourtesy. It is a rare writer who can say all
that need be said in one line and not seem rude. But it can be done.</p>

<p>The single purpose of a letter is to convey thought. That thought may
have to do with facts, and the further purpose may be to have the
thought produce action. But plainly the action depends solely upon how
well the thought is transferred. Words as used in a letter are vehicles
for thought, but every word is not a vehicle for thought, because it may
not be the kind of word that goes to the place where you want your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>thought to go; or, to put it another way, there is a wide variation in
the understanding of words. The average American vocabulary is quite
limited, and where an exactly phrased letter might completely convey an
exact thought to a person of education, that same letter might be
meaningless to a person who understands but few words. Therefore, it is
fatal in general letter writing to venture into unusual words or to go
much beyond the vocabulary of, say, a grammar school graduate.
Statistics show that the ordinary adult in the United States&mdash;that is,
the great American public&mdash;has either no high school education or less
than a year of it. You can assume in writing to a man whom you do not
know and about whom you have no information that he has only a grammar
school education and that in using other than commonplace words you run
a double danger&mdash;first, that he will not know what you are talking about
or will misinterpret it; and second, that he will think you are trying
to be highfalutin and will resent your possibly quite innocent parade of
language.</p>

<p>In a few very effective sales letters the writers have taken exactly the
opposite tack. They have slung language in the fashion of a circus
publicity agent, and by their verbal gymnastics have attracted
attention. This sort of thing may do very well in some kinds of circular
letters, but it is quite out of place in the common run of business
correspondence, and a comparison of the sales letters of many companies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>with their day-to-day correspondence shows clearly the need for more
attention to the day-to-day letter. A sales letter may be bought. A
number of very competent men make a business of writing letters for
special purposes. But a higher tone in general correspondence cannot be
bought and paid for. It has to be developed. A good letter writer will
neither insult the intelligence of his correspondent by making the
letter too childish, nor will he make the mistake of going over his
head. He will visualize who is going to receive his letter and use the
kind of language that seems best to fit both the subject matter and the
reader, and he will give the fitting of the words to the reader the
first choice.</p>

<p>There is something of a feeling that letters should be elegant&mdash;that if
one merely expresses oneself simply and clearly, it is because of some
lack of erudition, and that true erudition breaks out in great, sonorous
words and involved constructions. There could be no greater mistake. The
man who really knows the language will write simply. The man who does
not know the language and is affecting something which he thinks is
culture has what might be called a sense of linguistic insecurity, which
is akin to the sense of social insecurity. Now and again one meets a
person who is dreadfully afraid of making a social error. He is afraid
of getting hold of the wrong fork or of doing something else that is not
done. Such people labor along frightfully. They have a perfectly vile
time of it, but any one who knows social <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>usage takes it as a matter of
course. He observes the rules, not because they are rules, but because
they are second nature to him, and he shamelessly violates the rules if
the occasion seems to warrant it. It is quite the same with the letter.
One should know his ground well enough to do what one likes, bearing in
mind that there is no reason for writing a letter unless the objective
is clearly defined. Writing a letter is like shooting at a target. The
target may be hit by accident, but it is more apt to be hit if careful
aim has been taken.</p>

<h2>THE PARTS OF A LETTER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mechanical construction of a letter, whether social, friendly, or
business, falls into six or seven parts. This arrangement has become
established by the best custom. The divisions are as follows:</p>

<p class="hang3 nob">1. Heading</p>
<p class="hang3 not nob">2. Inside address (Always used in business letters but omitted in social and friendly letters)</p>
<p class="hang3 not nob">3. Salutation</p>
<p class="hang3 not nob">4. Body</p>
<p class="hang3 not nob">5. Complimentary close</p>
<p class="hang3 not nob">6. Signature</p>
<p class="hang3 not">7.Superscription</p>

<h3><a name="part1" id="part1"></a>1. <span class="smcap">The Heading</span></h3>

<p>The heading of a letter contains the street address, city, state, and
the date. The examples below will illustrate:</p>

<table summary="examples" style="width: 30em;">
<colgroup span="3">
<col width="35%"></col>

<a href="#illus">Back to list of illustration</a></span>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>When the heading is typewritten or written by hand, it is placed at the
top of the first letter sheet close to the right-hand margin. It should
begin about in the center, that is, it should extend no farther to the
left than the center of the page. If a letter is short and therefore
placed in the center of a page, the heading will of course be lower
and farther in from the edge than in a longer letter. But it should
never be less than an inch from the top and three quarters of an inch
from the edge.</p>

<p>In the business letterhead appear the name of the firm, its address, and
the kind of business engaged in. The last is often omitted in the case
of widely known firms or where the nature of the business is indicated
by the name of the firm.</p>

<p>In the case of a printed or engraved letterhead, the written heading
should consist only of the date. The printed date-line is not good. To
mix printed and written or typed characters detracts from the neat
appearance of the letter.</p>

<p>In social stationery the address, when engraved, should be about three
quarters of an inch from the top of the sheet, either in the center or
at the right-hand corner. When the address is engraved, the date may be
written at the end of the last sheet, from the left-hand corner,
directly after the signature.</p>

<h3><a name="part2" id="part2"></a>2. <span class="smcap">The Inside Address</span></h3>

<p>In social correspondence what is known as the inside address is omitted.
In all business correspondence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>it is obviously necessary. The name and
address of the person to whom a business letter is sent is placed at the
left-hand side of the letter sheet below the heading, about an inch from
the edge of the sheet, that is, leaving the same margin as in the body
of the letter. The distance below the heading will be decided by the
length and arrangement of the letter. The inside address consists of the
name of the person or of the firm and the address. The address should
comprise the street number, the city, and the state. The state may, in
the case of certain very large cities, be omitted. Either of the
following styles may be used&mdash;the straight edge or the diagonal:</p>


<p class="block5 s">Wharton &amp; Whaley Co.<br />
    Madison Avenue &amp; Forty-Fifth Street<br />

    New York, N. Y.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p class="block5 s">Wharton &amp; Whaley Co.</p>
      <p class="block5a s">Madison Avenue &amp; Forty-Fifth Street</p>
        <p class="block5b s">New York, N. Y.</p>


<p>Punctuation at the ends of the lines of the heading and the address may
or may not be used. There is a growing tendency to omit it.</p>

<p>The inside address may be written at the end of the letter, from the
left, below the signature. This is done in official letters, both formal
and informal. These official letters are further described under the
heading "Salutation" and in the chapter on stationery.</p>


<h3><a name="part3" id="part3"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>3. <span class="smcap">The Salutation</span></h3>

<p class="noi"><em>Social Letters</em></p>

<p>The salutation, or complimentary address to the person to whom the
letter is written, in a social letter should begin at the left-hand side
of the sheet about half an inch below the heading and an inch from the
edge of the paper. The form "My dear" is considered in the United States
more formal than "Dear." Thus, when we write to a woman who is simply an
acquaintance, we should say "My dear Mrs. Evans." If we are writing to
someone more intimate we should say "Dear Mrs. Evans." The opposite is
true in England&mdash;that is, "My dear Mrs. Evans" would be written to a
friend and "Dear Mrs. Evans" to a mere acquaintance. In writing to an
absolute stranger, the full name should be written and then immediately
under it, slightly to the right, "Dear Madam" or "Dear Sir." For
example:</p>

<p class="block5 s">Mrs. John Evans,</p>
      <p class="block5b s">Dear Madam:</p>

<p>or</p>

<p class="block5 s">Mr. William Sykes,</p>
      <p class="block5b s">Dear Sir:</p>

<p>The salutation is followed by a colon or a comma.</p>


<p class="noi"><em>Business Letters</em></p>

<p>In business letters the forms of salutation in common use are: "Dear
Sir," "Gentlemen," "Dear <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Madam," and "Mesdames." In the still more
formal "My dear Sir" and "My dear Madam" note that the second word is
not capitalized. A woman, whether married or unmarried, is addressed
"Dear Madam." If the writer of the letter is personally acquainted with
the person addressed, or if they have had much correspondence, he may
use the less formal address, as "My dear Mr. Sykes."</p>

<p>The salutation follows the inside address and preserves the same margin
as does the first line of the address. The following are correct forms:</p>

<table summary="examples" style="width: 30em;">

<td colspan="2">Gentlemen:</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>"Dear Sirs" is no longer much used&mdash;although in many ways it seems to be
better taste.</p>

<p>In the case of a firm or corporation with a single name, as Daniel
Davey, Inc., or of a firm or corporation consisting of men and women,
the salutation is also "Gentlemen" (or "Dear Sirs"). In letters to or by
government officials the extremely formal "Sir" or "Sirs" is used. These
are known as formal official letters.</p>

<p>The informal official letter is used between business men and concerns
things not in the regular routine of business affairs. These letters are
decidedly informal and may be quite conversational in tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The use of a name alone as a salutation is not correct, as:</p>

<p class="salute2 s nob">Mr. John Evans:</p>
<p class="three not s">I have your letter of&mdash;</p>

<p>Forms of salutation to be avoided are "Dear Miss," "Dear Friend,"
"Messrs."</p>

<p>In memoranda between members of a company the salutations are commonly
omitted&mdash;but these memoranda are not letters. They are messages of a
"telegraphic" nature.</p>

<p class="noi"><em>Titles</em></p>

<p>In the matter of titles it has been established by long custom that a
title of some kind be used with the name of the individual or firm. The
more usual titles are:</p>

<p>"Mr.," "Mrs.," "Miss," "Messrs.," "Reverend," "Doctor," "Professor," and
"Honorable." "Esquire," written "Esq." is used in England instead of the
"Mr." in common use in the United States. Although still adhered to by
some in this country, its use is rather restricted to social letters. Of
course it is never used with "Mr." Write either "Mr. George L. Ashley"
or "George L. Ashley, Esq."</p>

<p>The title "Messrs." is used in addressing two or more persons who are in
business partnership, as "Messrs. Brown and Clark" or "Brown &amp; Clark";
but The National Cash Register Company, for example, should not be
addressed "Messrs. National Cash Register Company" but "The National
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Cash Register Company." The form "Messrs." is an abbreviation of
"Messieurs" and should not be abbreviated in any way other than
"Messrs." The title "Miss" is not recognized as an abbreviation and is
not followed by a period.</p>

<p>Honorary degrees, such as "M.D.," "Ph.D.," "M.A.," "B.S.," "LL.D.,"
follow the name of the person addressed. The initials "M.D." must not be
used in connection with "Doctor" as this would be a duplication. Write
either "Dr. Herbert Reynolds" or "Herbert Reynolds, M.D." The titles of
"Doctor," "Reverend," and "Professor" precede the name of the addressed,
as: "Dr. Herbert Reynolds," "Rev. Philip Bentley," "Prof. Lucius
Palmer." It will be observed that these titles are usually abbreviated
on the envelope and in the inside address, but in the salutation they
must be written out in full, as "My dear Doctor," or "My dear
Professor." In formal notes one writes "My dear Doctor Reynolds" or "My
dear Professor Palmer." In less formal notes, "Dear Doctor Reynolds" and
"Dear Professor Palmer" may be used.</p>

<p>A question of taste arises in the use of "Doctor." The medical student
completing the studies which would ordinarily lead to a bachelor's
degree is known as "Doctor," and the term has become associated in the
popular mind with medicine and surgery. The title "Doctor" is, however,
an academic distinction, and although applied to all graduate medical
practitioners <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>is, in all other realms of learning, a degree awarded for
graduate work, as Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), or for distinguished
services that cause a collegiate institution to confer an honorary
degree such as Doctor of Common Law (D.C.L.), Doctor of Law and
Literature (LL.D.), Doctor of Science (Sc.D.), and so on. Every holder
of a doctor's degree is entitled to be addressed as "Doctor," but in
practice the salutation is rarely given to the holders of the honorary
degrees&mdash;mostly because they do not care for it.</p>

<p>Do not use "Mr." or "Esq." with any of the titles mentioned above.</p>

<p>The President of the United States should be addressed formally as
"Sir," informally as "My dear Mr. President."</p>

<p>Members of Congress and of the state legislatures, diplomatic
representatives, judges, and justices are entitled "Honorable," as
"Honorable Samuel Sloane," thus:</p>

<div class="block">
    <p class="center nob s">(Formal)</p>
    <p class="noi not nob s">Honorable (or Hon.) John Henley</p>
    <p class="noi not s">Sir:</p>

</div>

<div class="block">
    <p class="center nob s">(Informal)</p>
    <p class="noi not nob s">Honorable (or Hon.) John Henley</p>
    <p class="noi not s">My dear Mr. Henley:</p>
</div>

<p>Titles such as "Cashier," "Secretary," and "Agent" are in the nature of
descriptions and follow the name; as "Mr. Charles Hamill, Cashier."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>When such titles as "Honorable" and "Reverend" are used in the body of
the letter they are preceded by the article "the." Thus, "The Honorable
Samuel Sloane will address the meeting."</p>

<p>A woman should never be addressed by her husband's title. Thus the wife
of a doctor is not "Mrs. Dr. Royce" but "Mrs. Paul Royce." The titles of
"Judge," "General," and "Doctor" belong to the husband only. Of course,
if a woman has a title of her own, she may use it. If she is an "M.D."
she will be designated as "Dr. Elizabeth Ward." In this case her
husband's Christian name would not be used.</p>

<p>In writing to the clergy, the following rules should be observed:</p>

<p>For a Cardinal the only salutation is "Your Eminence." The address on
the envelope should read "His Eminence John Cardinal Farley."</p>

<p>To an Archbishop one should write "Most Rev. Patrick J. Hayes, D.D.,
Archbishop of New York." The salutation is usually "Your Grace,"
although it is quite admissible to use "Dear Archbishop." The former is
preferable and of more common usage.</p>

<p>The correct form of address for a Bishop is "The Right Reverend John
Jones, D.D., Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;." The salutation in a formal letter should
be "Right Reverend and dear Sir," but this would be used only in a
strictly formal communication. In this salutation "dear" is sometimes
capitalized, so that it would read "Right Reverend and Dear Sir";
although the form in the text seems preferable, some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>bishops use the
capitalized "Dear." The usual form is "My dear Bishop," with "The Right
Reverend John Jones, D.D., Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;" written above it. In the
Protestant Episcopal Church a Dean is addressed "The Very Reverend John
Jones, D.D., Dean of &mdash;&mdash;." The informal salutation is "My dear Dean
Jones" and the formal is "Very Reverend and dear Sir."</p>

<p>In addressing a priest, the formal salutation is "Reverend and dear
Sir," or "Reverend dear Father." The envelope reads simply: "The Rev.
Joseph J. Smith," followed by any titles the priest may enjoy.</p>

<p>The form used in addressing the other clergy is "The Reverend John
Jones," and the letter, if strictly formal, would commence with
"Reverend and Dear Sir." The more usual form, however, is "My dear Mr.
Brown" (or "Dr. Brown," as the case may be). The use of the title
"Reverend" with the surname only is wholly inadmissible.</p>

<p>In general usage the salutation in addressing formal correspondence to a
foreign ambassador is "His Excellency," to a Minister or Charg&eacute;
d'Affaires, "Sir." In informal correspondence the general form is "My
dear Mr. Ambassador," "My dear Mr. Minister," or "My dear Mr. Charg&eacute;
d'Affaires."</p>


<h3><a name="part4" id="part4"></a>4. <span class="smcap">The Body of the Letter</span></h3>

<p class="b2">In the placing of a formal note it must be arranged so that the complete
note appears on the first page <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>only. The social letter is either formal
or informal. The formal letter must be written according to certain
established practice. It is the letter used for invitations to formal
affairs, for announcements, and for the acknowledgment of these letters.
The third person must always be used. If one receives a letter written
in the third person one must answer in kind. It would be obviously
incongruous to write</p>

 <p class="center s b3">Mr. and Mrs. John Evans<br />
    regret that we are unable to accept<br />
               Mrs. Elliott's<br />
      kind invitation for the theatre<br />

        on Thursday, May the fourth<br />
      as we have a previous engagement</p>

<p class="b2">It should read</p>

<p class="center s b2">Mr. and Mrs. John Evans<br />
    regret that they are unable to accept<br />
               Mrs. Elliott's<br />

      kind invitation for the theatre<br />
        on Thursday, May the fourth<br />
      as they have a previous engagement</p>

<p>In these notes, the hour and date are never written numerically but are
spelled out.</p>

<p>If the family has a coat-of-arms or crest it may be used in the centre
of the engraved invitation at the top, but monograms or stamped
addresses are never so used.</p>

<p>For the informal letter there are no set rules except that of courtesy,
which requires that we have our <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>thought distinctly in mind before
putting it on paper. It may be necessary to pause a few moments before
writing, to think out just what we want to say. A rambling, incoherent
letter is not in good taste any more than careless, dishevelled
clothing. Spelling should be correct. If there is any difficulty in
spelling, a small dictionary kept in the desk drawer is easily
consulted. Begin each sentence with a capital. Start a new paragraph
when you change to a new subject. Put periods (or interrogation points
as required) at the ends of the sentences. It is neater to preserve a
margin on both sides of the letter sheet.</p>

<p>In the body of a business letter the opening sentence is in an important
position, and this is obviously the place for an important fact. It
ought in some way to state or refer to the subject of or reason for the
letter, so as to get the attention of the reader immediately to the
subject.</p>

<p class="b2">It ought also to suggest a courteous personal interest in the
recipient's business, to give the impression of having to do with his
interests. For instance, a reader might be antagonized by</p>

<p class="s b2">Yours of the 14th regarding the shortage in your last order</p>

<p class="b2 noi">How much more tactful is</p>

<p class="s b2">
We regret to learn from your letter of March 14th that there was a shortage in your last order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Paragraphs should show the division of the thought of the letter. If you
can arrange and group your subjects and your thoughts on them logically
in your mind, you will have no trouble in putting them on paper. It is
easier for the reader to grasp your thought if in each paragraph are
contained only one thought and the ideas pertaining to it.</p>

<p>The appearance of a business letter is a matter to which all too little
concern has been given. A firm or business which would not tolerate an
unkempt salesman sometimes will think nothing of sending out badly
typed, badly placed, badly spelled letters.</p>

<p>The first step toward a good-looking letter is proper stationery, though
a carefully typed and placed letter on poor stationery is far better
than one on good stationery with a good letterhead but poor typing and
placing.</p>

<p>The matter of correct spelling is merely a case of the will to consult a
dictionary when in doubt.</p>

<p>The proper placing of a letter is something which well rewards the care
necessary at first. Estimate the matter to go on the page with regard to
the size of the page and arrange so that the centre of the letter will
be slightly above the centre of the letter sheet. The margins should act
as a frame or setting for the letter. The left-hand space should be at
least an inch and the right-hand at least a half inch. Of course if the
letter is short the margins will be wider. The top and bottom margins
should be wider than the side margins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>The body of the letter should begin at the same distance from the edge as the first line of the inside address and the salutation.</p>

<p>All paragraphing should be indicated by indenting the same distances
from the margin&mdash;about an inch&mdash;or if the block system is used no
paragraph indentation is made but double or triple spacing between the
paragraphs indicates the divisions. If the letter is handwritten, the
spacing between the paragraphs should be noticeably greater than that
between other lines.</p>

<p>Never write on both sides of a sheet. In writing a business letter, if
the letter requires more than one page, use plain sheets of the same
size and quality without the letterhead. These additional sheets should
be numbered at the top. The name or initials of the firm or person to
whom the letter is going should also appear at the top of the sheets.
This letter should never run over to a second sheet if there are less
than three lines of the body of the letter left over from the first
page.</p>

<p>In the formal official letter, that is, in letters to or by government
officials, members of Congress, and other dignitaries, the most rigid
formality in language is observed. No colloquialisms are allowed and no
abbreviations.</p>

</div>


<h3><a name="part5" id="part5"></a>5. <span class="smcap">The Complimentary Close</span></h3>

<p>The complimentary close follows the body of the letter, about two or
three spaces below it. It begins <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>about in the center of the page under
the body of the letter. Only the first word should be capitalized and a
comma is placed at the end. The wording may vary according to the degree
of cordiality or friendship. In business letters the forms are usually
restricted to the following:</p>
    <p class="three nob">Yours truly (or) Truly yours (not good form)</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours very truly (or) Very truly yours</p>

    <p class="three not nob">Yours respectfully (or) Respectfully yours</p>
    <p class="three not">Yours very respectfully.</p>


<p>If the correspondents are on a more intimate basis they may use</p>

    <p class="three nob">Faithfully yours</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Cordially yours</p>

    <p class="three not">Sincerely yours.</p>


<p>In formal official letters the complimentary close is</p>

    <p class="three nob">Respectfully yours</p>
    <p class="three not">Yours respectfully.</p>

<p>The informal social letter may close with</p>


    <p class="three nob">Yours sincerely</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours very sincerely</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours cordially</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours faithfully</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours gratefully (if a favor has been done)</p>

    <p class="three not nob">Yours affectionately</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Very affectionately yours</p>
    <p class="three not nob">Yours lovingly</p>
    <p class="three not">Lovingly yours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>The position of "yours" may be at the beginning or at the end, but it
must never be abbreviated or omitted.</p>

<p>If a touch of formal courtesy is desired, the forms "I am" or "I remain"
may be used before the complimentary closing. These words keep the same
margin as the paragraph indenting. But in business letters they are not
used.</p>


<h3><a name="part6" id="part6"></a>6. <span class="smcap"><a name="chap3" id="chap3"></a>The Signature</span></h3>

<p>The signature is written below the complimentary close and a little to
the right, so that it ends about at the right-hand margin. In signing a
social letter a married woman signs herself as "Evelyn Rundell," not
"Mrs. James Rundell" nor "Mrs. Evelyn Rundell." The form "Mrs. James
Rundell" is used in business letters when the recipient might be in
doubt as to whether to address her as "Mrs." or "Miss." Thus a married
woman would sign such a business letter:</p>

<p class="center s nob">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="center s not nob">Evelyn Rundell</p>
<p class="center s not b2">(Mrs. James Rundell).</p>

<p>An unmarried woman signs as "Ruth Evans," excepting in the case of a
business letter where she might be mistaken for a widow. She then
prefixes "Miss" in parentheses, as (Miss) Ruth Evans.</p>

<p>A woman should not sign only her given name in a letter to a man unless
he is her fianc&eacute; or a relative or an old family friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>A widow signs her name with "Mrs." in parentheses before it, as (Mrs.)
Susan Briggs Geer.</p>

<p>A divorced woman, if she retains her husband's name, signs her letters
with her given name and her own surname followed by her husband's name,
thus:</p>

<p class="center s">Janet Hawkins Carr.</p>

<p class="noi">and in a business communication:</p>

<p class="center s not nob">Janet Hawkins Carr</p>
<p class="center s not b2">(Mrs. Janet Hawkins Carr).</p>

<p>A signature should always be made by hand and in ink. The signature to a
business letter may be simply the name of the writer. Business firms or
corporations have the name of the firm typed above the written signature
of the writer of the letter. Then in type below comes his official
position. Thus:</p>

<p class="center s nob">Hall, Haines &amp; Company (typewritten)</p>
<p class="center s not nob"><em>Alfred Jennings</em> (handwritten)</p>

<p class="center s not b2">Cashier (typewritten).</p>

<p>If he is not an official, his signature is preceded by the word "By."</p>

<p>In the case of form letters or routine correspondence the name of the
person directly responsible for the letter may be signed by a clerk with
his initials just below it. Some business firms have the name of the
person responsible for the letter typed immediately under the name of
the firm and then his signature below that. This custom counteracts
illegibility in signatures.</p>

<p class="b2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>In circular letters the matter of a personal signature is a very
important one. Some good points on this subject may be gathered from the
following extract from <em>Printers' Ink</em>.</p>

<p class="quote s">Who shall sign a circular letter depends largely on
    circumstances entering individual cases. Generally speaking,
    every letter should be tested on a trial list before it is sent
    out in large quantities. It is inadvisable to hazard an
    uncertain letter idea on a large list until the value of the
    plan, as applied to that particular business, has been tried
    out.</p>

<p class="quote s">There are certain things about letter procedure, however, that
    experience has demonstrated to be fundamental. One of these
    platforms is that it is best to sign the letter with some
    individual's name. Covering up the responsibility for the letter
    with such a general term as "sales department" or "advertising
    department" takes all personality out of the missive and to that
    extent weakens the power of the message. But even in this we
    should be chary of following inflexible rules. We can conceive
    of circumstances where it would be advisable to have the letter
    come from a department rather than from an individual.</p>

  <p class="quote s">Of course the management of many business organizations still
    holds that all letters should be signed by the company only. If
    the personal touch is permitted at all, the extent of it is to
    allow the writer of the letter to subscribe his initials. This
    idea, however, is pretty generally regarded as old-fashioned and
    is fast dying out.</p>

<p class="quote s">Most companies favor the plan of having the head of the
    department sign the circular letters emanating from his
    department. If he doesn't actually dictate the letter himself,
    no tell-tale signs such as the initials of the actual dictator
    should be made. If it is a sales matter, the letter would bear
    the signature of the sales manager. If the communication
    pertained to advertising, it would be signed by the advertising
    manager. Where it is desired to give unusual emphasis to the
    letter, it might occasionally <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>be attributed to the president or
    to some other official higher up. The big name idea should not
    be overdone. People will soon catch on that the president would
    not have time to answer all of the company's correspondence. If
    he has, it is evident that a very small business must be done.</p>

    <p class="quote s">A better idea that is coming into wide vogue is to have the
    letter signed by the man in the company who comes into
    occasional personal contact with the addressee. One concern has
    the house salesman who waits on customers coming from that
    section of the country when they visit headquarters sign all
    promotion letters going to them. The house salesman is the only
    one in the firm whom the customer knows. It is reasoned that the
    latter will give greater heed to a letter coming from a man with
    whom he is on friendly terms. Another company has its branch
    managers take the responsibility for circular letters sent to
    the trade in that territory. Another manufacturer has his
    salesmen bunched in crews of six. Each crew is headed by a
    leader. This man has to sell, just as his men do, but in
    addition he acts as a sort of district sales manager. All trade
    letters going out in his district carry the crew leader's
    signature.</p>

    <p class="quote s b2">There is much to be said in favor of this vogue. Personal
    contact is so valuable in all business transactions that its
    influence should be used in letters, in so far as it is
    practicable to do so.</p>

<p>The signature should not vary. Do not sign "G. Smith" to one letter,
"George Smith" to another, and "G. B. Smith" to a third.</p>

<p>A man should never prefix to his signature any title, as "Mr.," "Prof.,"
or "Dr."</p>

<p>A postscript is sometimes appended to a business letter, but the letters
"P.S." do not appear. It is not, however, used as formerly&mdash;to express
some thought which the writer forgot to include in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>letter, or an afterthought. But on account of its unique position in the letter, it is
used to place special emphasis on an important thought.</p>


<h3><a name="part7" id="part7"></a>7. <span class="smcap">The Superscription</span></h3>

<p>In the outside address or superscription of a letter the following forms
are observed:</p>

<p>A letter to a woman must always address her as either "Mrs." or "Miss,"
unless she is a professional woman with a title such as "Dr." But this
title is used only if the letter is a professional one. It is not
employed in social correspondence. A woman is never addressed by her
husband's title, as "Mrs. Captain Bartlett."</p>

<p>A married woman is addressed with "Mrs." prefixed to her husband's name,
as "Mrs. David Greene." This holds even if her husband is dead.</p>

<p>A divorced woman is addressed (unless she is allowed by the courts to
use her maiden name) as "Mrs." followed by her maiden name and her
former husband's surname, as: "Mrs. Edna Boyce Blair," "Edna Boyce"
being her maiden name.</p>

<p>A man should be given his title if he possess one. Otherwise he must be
addressed as "Mr." or "Esq."</p>

<p>Titles of those holding public office, of physicians, of the clergy, and
of professors, are generally abbreviated on the envelope except in
formal letters.</p>

<p>It is rather customary to address social letters to "Edward Beech,
Esq.," business letters to "Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Edward Beech," and a tradesman's letter
to "Peter Moore." A servant is addressed as "William White."</p>

<p>The idea has arisen, and it would seem erroneous, that if the man
addressed had also "Sr." or "Jr." attached, the title "Mr." or "Esq."
should not be used. There is neither rhyme nor reason for this, as "Sr."
and "Jr." are certainly not titles and using "Mr." or "Esq." would not
be a duplication. So the proper mode of address would be</p>

<p class="center s">Mr. John Evans, Jr.</p>

<p class="noi">or</p>

<p class="center s b2">John Evans, Jr., Esq.</p>

<p>The "Sr." is not always necessary as it may be understood.</p>

<p>Business envelopes should have the address of the writer printed in the
upper left-hand corner as a return address. This space should not be
used for advertising.</p>

<p>In addressing children's letters, it should be remembered that a letter
to a girl child is addressed to "Miss Jane Green," regardless of the age
of the child. But a little boy should be addressed as "Master Joseph
Green."</p>

<p>The address when completed should be slightly below the middle of the
envelope and equidistant from right and left edges. The slanting or the
straight-edge form may be used, to agree with the indented or the block
style of paragraphing respectively.</p>

<p>Punctuation at the ends of the lines in the envelope address is not
generally used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>The post office prefers the slanting edge form of address, thus:</p>

<table summary="example" style="width: 80%;" class="b2">
<colgroup span="2">
<col width="50%"></col>
<col width="50%"></col>
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="three">(not)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="one">____________________</td>

<td>____________________</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="two">____________________</td>
<td>____________________</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="three">____________________</td>
<td>____________________</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If there is a special address, such as "General Delivery," "Personal,"
or "Please forward," it should be placed at the lower left-hand corner
of the envelope.</p>

<h2>BEING APPROPRIATE&mdash;WHAT TO AVOID</h2>

<h3><a name="offenses" id="offenses"></a><span class="smcap">Commom Offenses</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> this head are grouped a few of the more common offenses against
good form in letter writing; some of these have been touched on in other
chapters.</p>

<p class="hang s">Never use ruled paper for any correspondence.</p>

 <p class="hang s">   Never use tinted paper for business letters.</p>

 <p class="hang s">   Do not have date lines on printed letterheads. This of course
    has to do with business stationery.</p>

 <p class="hang s">   Do not use simplified spelling, if for no other reason than that
    it detracts from the reader's absorption of the contents of the
    letter itself.</p>

<p class="hang s">    "Enthuse" is not a word&mdash;do not use it.</p>

<p class="hang s">    Avoid blots, fingermarks, and erasures.</p>

<p class="hang s">    Do not use two one-cent stamps in place of a two-cent stamp.
    Somehow one-cent stamps are not dignified.</p>

<p class="hang s">Never use "Dear Friend," "Friend Jack," "My dear Friend," or "Friend Bliss" as a form of salutation. In the case of a
    business letter where a salutation for both sexes may be
    necessary, use "Gentlemen."</p>

    <p class="hang s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Never cross the writing in a letter with more writing.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Never use "oblige" in the place of the complimentary close.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not double titles, as "Mr. John Walker, Esq." Write either
    "Mr. John Walker" or "John Walker, Esq."</p>

    <p class="hang s">A woman should never sign herself "Mrs." or "Miss" to a social
    letter. In business letters (See <a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a>) it may be necessary
    to prefix "Mrs." or "Miss" in parentheses to show how an answer
    should be addressed to her.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Never omit "Yours" in the complimentary close. Always write
    "Yours sincerely," "Yours truly," or whatever it may be. Never
    write a letter in the heat of anger. Sleep on it if you do and
    the next morning will not see you so anxious to send it.</p>

   <p class="hang s"> In some business offices it has become the custom to have typed
    at the bottom of a letter, or sometimes even rubber-stamped,
    such expressions as:<br />
    <span class="one">Dictated but not read.</span><br />
    <span class="one">Dictated by but signed in the absence of &mdash;&mdash;.</span><br />

    <span class="one">Dictated by Mr. Jones, but, as Mr. Jones was called away, signed
    by Miss Walker.</span></p>

<p class="hang s">While these may be the circumstances under which the letter
    was written and may be necessary for the identification of the
    letter, they are no less discourtesies to the reader. And it
    cannot improve the situation to call them to the reader's
    attention.</p>

    <p class="hang s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>In the matter of abbreviations of titles and the like a safe
    rule is "When in doubt do not abbreviate."</p>

    <p class="hang s">Sentences like "Dictated by Mr. Henry Pearson to Miss Oliver"
    are in bad form, not to speak of their being bad business. They
    intrude the mechanics of the letter on the reader and in so
    doing they take his interest from the actual object of the
    communication. All necessary identification can be made by
    initials, <span class="nowrap">as: L. S. B.&mdash;T.</span></p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not write a sales letter that gives the same impression as a
    strident, raucous-voiced salesman. If the idea is to attract
    attention by shouting louder than all the rest, it might be well
    to remember that the limit of screeching and of words that hit
    one in the eye has probably been reached. The tack to take, even
    from a result-producing standpoint and aside from the question
    of good taste, is to have the tone of the letter quiet but
    forceful&mdash;the firm, even tone of a voice heard through a yelling
    mob.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not attempt to put anything on paper without first thinking
    out and arranging what you want to say.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Complimentary closings in business letters, such as "Yours for
    more business," should be avoided as the plague.</p>


<h3><a name="stock1" id="stock1"></a><span class="smcap">Stock Phrases in Business Letters</span></h3>

<p>There are certain expressions, certain stock phrases, which have in the
past been considered absolutely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>necessary to a proper knowledge of
so-called business English. But it is gratifying to notice the emphasis
that professors and teachers of business English are placing on the
avoidance of these horrors and on the adoption of a method of writing in
which one says exactly what one means and says it gracefully and without
stiltedness or intimacy. Their aim seems to be the ability to write a
business letter which may be easily read, easily understood, and with
the important facts in the attention-compelling places. But for the sake
of those who still cling to these hackneyed improprieties (which most of
them are), let us line them up for inspection. Many of them are
inaccurate, and a moment's thought will give a better method of
conveying the ideas.</p>

<p>"We beg to state," "We beg to advise," "We beg to remain." There is a
cringing touch about these. A courteous letter may be written without
begging.</p>

<p>"Your letter has come to hand" or "is at hand" belongs to a past age.
Say "We have your letter of &mdash;&mdash;" or "We have received your letter."</p>

<p>"We shall advise you of &mdash;&mdash;" This is a legal expression. Say "We shall
let you know" or "We shall inform you."</p>

<p>"As per your letter." Also of legal connotation. Say "according to" or
"in agreement with."</p>

<p>"Your esteemed favor" is another relic. This is a form of courtesy, but
is obsolete. "Favor," used to mean "communication" or "letter," is
obviously inaccurate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>"Replying to your letter, would say," or "wish to say." Why not say it
at once and abolish the wordiness?</p>

<p>"State" gives the unpleasant suggestion of a cross-examination. Use
"say."</p>

<p>"And oblige" adds nothing to the letter. If the reader is not already
influenced by its contents, "and oblige" will not induce him to be.</p>

<p>The telegraphic brevity caused by omitting pronouns and all words not
necessary to the sense makes for discourtesy and brusqueness, as:</p>

<p class="b2 s">Answering yours of the 21st inst., order has been delayed, but
will ship goods at once.</p>

<p class="b2 noi">How much better to say:</p>

 <p class="b2 s">We have your letter of 21st October concerning the delay in
    filling your order. We greatly regret the delay, but we can
    now ship the goods at once.</p>

<p>"Same" is not a pronoun. It is used as such in legal documents, but it
is incorrect to employ it in business letters as other than an
adjective. Use instead "they," "them," or "it."</p>

<p class="noi"><em>Incorrect:</em></p>

<p class="b2 s">We have received your order and same will be forwarded.</p>

<p class="noi"><em>Correct:</em></p>
<p class="b2 s">We have received your order and it will be forwarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>"Kindly"&mdash;as in: "We kindly request that you will send your
subscription." There is nothing kind in your request and if there were,
you would not so allude to it. "Kindly" in this case belongs to "send,"
as "We request that you will kindly send your subscription."</p>

<p>The word "kind" to describe a business letter&mdash;as "your kind favor"&mdash;is
obviously misapplied. There is no element of "kindness" on either side
of an ordinary business transaction.</p>

<p>The months are no longer alluded to as "inst.," "ult.," or "prox."
[abbreviations of the Latin "instant" (present), "ultimo" (past), and
"proximo" (next)] as "Yours of the 10th inst." Call the months by name,
as "I have your letter of 10th May."</p>

<p>"Contents carefully noted" is superfluous and its impression on the
reader is a blank.</p>

<p>"I enclose herewith." "Herewith" in this sense means in the envelope.
This fact is already expressed in the word "enclose."</p>

<p>Avoid abbreviations of ordinary words in the body or the closing of a
letter, as "Resp. Yrs." instead of "Respectfully yours."</p>

<p>The word "Company" should not be abbreviated unless the symbol "&amp;" is
used. But the safest plan in writing to a company is to write the name
exactly as they write it themselves or as it appears on their
letterheads.</p>

the word &quot;company,&quot; the safest plan in writing to a company is to spell
its name exactly as it appears on its letterhead<br /><a href="#illus">Back to list of illustration</a></span>
</div>


<p>Names of months and names of states may be abbreviated in the heading of
the letter but not in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>the body. But it is better form not to do so. Names of states should never be abbreviated on the envelope. For
instance, "California" and "Colorado," if written "Cal." and "Col.," may
easily be mistaken for each other.</p>

<p>The participial closing of a letter, that is, ending a letter with a
participial phrase, weakens the entire effect of the letter. This is
particularly true of a business letter. Close with a clear-cut idea. The
following endings will illustrate the ineffective participle:</p>

<p class="hang s">Hoping to hear from you on this matter by return mail.</p>

<p class="hang s">Assuring you of our wish to be of service to you in the
    future.</p>

<p class="hang s">Thanking you for your order and hoping we shall be able to
    please you.</p>

<p class="hang s b2">Trusting that you will start an investigation as soon as
    possible.</p>

<p class="noi">More effective endings would be:</p>

 <p class="hang s">Please send a remittance by return mail.</p>

 <p class="hang s">If we can be of use to you in the future, will you let us
    know?</p>

  <p class="hang s">We thank you for your order and hope we shall fill it to
    your satisfaction.</p>

  <p class="hang s b2">Please investigate the delay at once.</p>

<p>The participial ending is merely a sort of habit. A letter used to be
considered lacking in ease if it ended with an emphatic sentence or
ended with something that had really to do with the subject of the
letter.</p>

<p>It might be well in concluding a letter, as in a personal leavetaking,
to "Stand not on the order of your going." Good-byes should be short.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL LETTERS&mdash;SOCIAL AND FRIENDLY</h2>


<h3><a name="acknowl" id="acknowl"></a><span class="smcap">Invitations and Acknowledgments</span></h3>


<p class="noi"><em>General Directions</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> format of an invitation is not so important as its taste. Some of
the more formal sorts of invitations&mdash;as to weddings&mdash;have become rather
fixed, and the set wordings are carried through regardless of the means
at hand for proper presentation. For instance, one often sees a wedding
invitation in impeccable form but badly printed on cheap paper. It would
be far better, if it is impossible to get good engraving or if
first-class work proves to be too expensive, to buy good white notepaper
and write the invitations. A typewriter is, of course, out of the
question either for sending or answering any sort of social invitation.
Probably some time in the future the typewriter will be used, but at
present it is associated with business correspondence and is supposed to
lack the implied leisure of hand writing.</p>

<p>The forms of many invitations, as I have said, are fairly fixed. But
they are not hallowed. One may vary them within the limits of good
taste, but on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>whole it is considerably easier to accept the forms
in use and not try to be different. If the function itself is going to
be very different from usual then the invitation itself may be as
freakish as one likes&mdash;it may be written or printed on anything from a
postcard to a paper bag. The sole question is one of appropriateness.
But there is a distinct danger in trying to be ever so unconventional
and all that. One is more apt than not to make a fool of one's self.
And then, too, being always clever is dreadfully hard on the innocent
by-standers. Here are things to be avoided:</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not have an invitation printed or badly engraved. Hand
    writing is better than bad mechanical work.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not use colored or fancy papers.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not use single sheets.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not use a very large or a very small sheet&mdash;either is
    inappropriate.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not have a formal phraseology for an informal affair.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not abbreviate anything&mdash;initials may be used in informal
    invitations and acceptances, but, in the formal, "H. E. Jones"
    invariably has to become "Horatio Etherington Jones."</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not send an answer to a formal invitation in the first
    person.</p>

    <p class="hang s">A formal invitation is written in the third person and must be
    so answered.</p>

<p class="hang s">Do not use visiting cards either for acceptances or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>regrets
    even though they are sometimes used for invitations. The
    practice of sending a card with "Accepts" or "Regrets" written
    on it is discourteous.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not seek to be decorative in handwriting&mdash;the flourishing
    Spencerian is impossible.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not overdo either the formality or the informality.</p>

    <p class="hang s">Do not use "R.S.V.P." (the initials of the French words
    "R&eacute;pondez, s'il vous pla&icirc;t," meaning "Answer, if you please")
    unless the information is really necessary for the making of
    arrangements. It ought to be presumed that those whom you take
    the trouble to invite will have the sense and the courtesy to
    answer.</p>

<p>In sending an evening invitation where there are husband and wife, both
must be included, unless, of course, the occasion is "stag." If the
invitation is to be extended to a daughter, then her name is included in
the invitation. In the case of more than one daughter, they will receive
a separate invitation addressed to "The Misses Smith." Each male member
of the family other than husband should receive a separately mailed
invitation.</p>

<p>An invitation, even the most informal, should always be acknowledged
within a week of its receipt. It is the height of discourtesy to leave
the hostess in doubt either through a tardy answer or through the
undecided character of your reply. The acknowledgment must state
definitely whether or not you accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>The acknowledgment of an invitation sent to husband and wife must
include both names but is answered by the wife only. The name of a
daughter also must appear if it appears in the invitation. If Mr. and
Mrs. Smith receive an invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Jones, their
acknowledgment must include the names of both Mr. and Mrs. Jones, but
the envelope should be addressed to Mrs. Jones only.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">FORMAL INVITATIONS</span></h4>

<p>Wedding invitations should be sent about three weeks&mdash;certainly not
later than fifteen days&mdash;before the wedding. Two envelopes should be
used, the name and address appearing on the outside envelope, but only
the name on the inside one. The following are correct for formal
invitations:</p>

<p class="noi"><em>For a church wedding</em></p>

<p class="noi"><em>For a second marriage</em></p>

<p>The forms followed in a second marriage&mdash;either of a widow or a
divorc&eacute;e&mdash;are quite the same as above. The divorc&eacute;e uses whatever name
she has taken after the divorce&mdash;the name of her ex-husband <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>or her
maiden name if she has resumed it. The widow sometimes uses simply Mrs.
Philip Brewster or a combination, as Mrs. Dorothy Evans Brewster. The

<p class="noi"><em>Wedding announcements</em></p>

<p>If a wedding is private, no formal invitations are sent out; they are
unnecessary, for only a few relatives or intimate friends will be
present and they will be asked by word of mouth or by a friendly note.
The wedding may be formally announced by cards mailed on the day of the
wedding. The announcement will be made by whoever would have sent out
wedding invitations&mdash;by parents, a near relative, or by the bride and
groom, according to circumstances. The custom with the bride's name in
the case of a widow or divorc&eacute;e follows that of wedding invitations. An
engraved announcement is not acknowledged (although a letter of
congratulations&mdash;<a href="#p101">see page 101</a>&mdash;may often be sent). A card is sent to the
bride's parents or whoever has sent the announcements. The announcement
may be in the following form:</p>

      <p class="center s b2"><em>Mr. and Mrs. John Evans</em><br />

      <em>Announce the Marriage of Their Daughter</em><br />
                      <em>Dorothy</em><br />

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><em>Replying to the invitation</em></p>

<p>The acceptance or the declination of a formal invitation is necessarily
formal but naturally has to be written by hand. It is better to use
double notepaper than a correspondence card and it is not necessary to
give a reason for being unable to be present&mdash;although one may be given.
It is impolite to accept or regret only a day or two before the
function&mdash;the letter should be written as soon as possible after the
receipt of the invitation. The letter may be indented as is the engraved
invitation, but this is not at all necessary. The forms are:</p>


<p class="noi"><em>Accepting</em></p>

       <p class="center s b2">Mr. and Mrs. Frothingham Smith<br />

              accept with pleasure<br />

<p class="noi"><em>For a wedding</em></p>

<p>An engraved invitation always implies a somewhat large or elaborate
formal function. An informal affair requires simply a written invitation
in the first person.</p>

<p>The informal wedding is one to which are invited only the immediate
family and intimate friends. The reason may be simply the desire for a
small, quiet affair or it may be a recent bereavement. The bride-to-be
generally writes these invitations. The form may be something like this:</p>

    try to come.</p>

<p class="b2">It may be of interest to read a letter or two from distinguished persons
along these lines. Here, for example, is the delightfully informal way
in which Thomas Bailey Aldrich invited his friend William H. Rideing to
dinner on one <span class="nowrap">occasion:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Rideing:</p>

    <p class="s">Will you come and take an informal bite with me to-morrow
    (Friday) at 6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> at my hamlet, No. 131 Charles Street?
    Mrs. Aldrich and the twins are away from home, and the
    thing is to be <em>sans ceremonie</em>. Costume prescribed: Sack
    coat, paper collar, and celluloid sleeve buttons. We shall
    be quite alone, unless Henry James should drop in, as he
    promises to do if he gets out of an earlier engagement.</p>

    <p class="s">Suppose you drop in at my office to-morrow afternoon about
    5 o'clock and I act as pilot to Charles Street.</p>

                                        <p class="close1 s">Yours very truly,</p>
                                          <p class="close2 s">T. B. Aldrich.</p>

     <p class="noi s">Dear Longfellow:</p>

    <p class="s">Will you dine with me on Saturday at six? I have a Baltimore
    friend coming, and depend on you.</p>

    <p class="s">I had such a pleasure yesterday that I should like to share it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>with you to whom I owed it. J. R. Osgood &amp; Co. sent me a copy
    of your Household Edition to show me what it was, as they
    propose one of me. I had been reading over with dismay my own
    poems to weed out the misprints, and was awfully disheartened
    to find how bad they (the poems) were. Then I took your book
    to see what the type was, and before I knew it I had been
    reading two hours and more. I never wondered at your
    popularity, nor thought it wicked in you; but if I <em>had</em>

    wondered, I should no longer, for you sang me out of all my
    worries. To be sure they came back when I opened my own book
    again&mdash;but that was no fault of yours.</p>

    <p class="s">If not Saturday, will you say Sunday? My friend is a Mrs.
    &mdash;&mdash;, and a very nice person indeed.</p>

    <p class="noi s">My dear Mrs. Smith,</p>

    <p class="s">With great regret I must write that I shall be unable to join
    your theatre party on Thursday evening, December the
    eighteenth. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>My two cousins are visiting me and we had planned

<p>For an informal affair, if at all in doubt as to what kind of invitation
to issue, it is safe to write a brief note in the first person.</p>

<p class="b2">Two or more sisters may receive one invitation addressed "The Misses
Evans." But two bachelor brothers must receive separate invitations. A
whole family should never be included in one invitation. It is decidedly
not proper to address one envelope to "Mr. and Mrs. Elliott and family."</p>


<p class="noi b2"><em>To an informal dance</em></p>

<p>Invitations to smaller and more informal dances may be short notes. Or a
visiting card is sometimes sent with a notation written in ink below the
hostess's name and toward the left, as shown below:</p>

<p>(A)</p>

<div class="block3 b2">
  <p class="center s">Mrs. John Evans<br />
                         At Home<br />

    <span class="left">January the eighteenth</span><br />
    <span class="left">R.S.V.P.</span></p>

</div>


<p class="b2">If the visiting card is used "R.S.V.P." is necessary, because usually invitations on visiting cards do <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>not presuppose answers. The reply to
the above may be either formal, in the third person, or may be an
informal note.</p>

    <p class="noi s">My dear Mrs. Elliott,</p>

    <p class="s">Will you and Mr. Elliott give us the pleasure of your company
    on Thursday, January the eighteenth, at ten o'clock? We are

acceptance or regret is proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p><p>An invitation to a house-party, which may imply a visit of several days'
duration (a week, ten days, or perhaps two weeks) must state exactly the
dates of the beginning and end of the visit. The hostess's letter should
mention the most convenient trains, indicating them on a timetable. The
guest at a week-end party knows he is to arrive on Friday afternoon or
Saturday morning and leave on the following Monday morning. It is
thoughtful for the hostess to give an idea of the activities or sports
planned. The letter might be somewhat in the following manner:</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Miss Evans,</p>

    <p class="s">Will you be one of our guests at a house-party we are
    planning? We shall be glad if you can arrange to come out to
    Glory View on August eighth and stay until the seventeenth. I
    have asked several of your friends, among them Mary Elliott
    and her brother.</p>

    hiking togs.</p>

    <p class="s">I enclose a timetable with the best trains marked. If you take
    the 4:29 on Thursday you can be here in time for dinner. Let

<h3><a name="condol" id="condol"></a><span class="smcap">The Letter of Condolence</span></h3>

<p>A letter of condolence may be written to relatives, close friends, and
to those whom we know well. When the recipient of the condolatory
message is simply an acquaintance, it is in better taste to send a
visiting card with "sincere sympathy." Flowers may or may not accompany
the card.</p>

<p>But in any case the letter should not be long, nor should it be crammed
with sad quotations and mushy sentiment. Of course, at best, writing a
condolence is a nice problem. Do not harrow feelings by too-familiar
allusions to the deceased. The letter should be sent immediately upon
receiving news of death.</p>

<p class="b2">When a card is received, the bereaved family acknowledge it a few weeks
later with an engraved acknowledgment on a black-bordered card. A
condolatory letter may be acknowledged by the recipient or by a relative
or friend who wishes to relieve the bereaved one of this task.</p>

<p class="noi b2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><em>Formal acknowledgment engraved on card</em></p>

    <p class="center b2"><em>Mrs. Gordon Burroughs and Family</em><br />
        <em>Gratefully acknowledge</em><br />
    <em>Your kind expression of sympathy</em></p>


<p class="b2">The cards, however, may be engraved with a space for the name to be
filled in:</p>

    <p class="center b2">_____________________________<br />
       <em>Gratefully acknowledge</em><br /><br />

    _____________________________<br />
    <em>Kind expression of sympathy</em></p>


<p class="b2">When the letter of condolence is sent from a distance, it is
acknowledged by a note from a member of the bereaved family. When the
writer of the condolence makes the customary call afterward, the family
usually makes a verbal acknowledgment and no written reply is required.</p>

<p class="b2">A letter of condolence that is something of a classic is Abraham

    <p class="noi s">Dear Madam:</p>

    <p class="s">I have been shown in the files of the War Department a
    statement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that you
    are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the
    field of battle. I feel how weak and fruitless must be any
    words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the
    grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from
    tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the
    thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our
    Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement,
    and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost,
    and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly
    a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.</p>

                              <p class="close1 s">Yours very sincerely and respectfully,</p>

<p class="b2">This is the letter<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that Robert E. Lee, when he was president of
Washington College, wrote to the father of a student who was drowned:</p>

                                        <p class="address1 s">Washington College,</p>

    <p class="noi s">My dear Sir:</p>

    <p class="s">Before this you have learned of the affecting death of your
    son. I can say nothing to mitigate your grief or to relieve
    your sorrow: but if the sincere sympathy of his comrades and
    friends and of the entire community can bring you any
    consolation, I can assure you that you possess it in its
    fullest extent. When one, in the pureness and freshness of
    youth, before having been contaminated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>by sin or afflicted by
    misery, is called to the presence of his Merciful Creator, it
    must be solely for his good. As difficult as this may be for
    you now to recognize, I hope you will keep it constantly in
    your memory and take it to your comfort; pray that He who in
    His wise Providence has permitted this crushing sorrow may
    sanctify it to the happiness of all. Your son and his friend,
    Mr. Birely, often passed their leisure hours in rowing on the
    river, and, on last Saturday afternoon, the 4th inst.,
    attempted what they had more than once been cautioned
    against&mdash;to approach the foot of the dam, at the public
    bridge. Unfortunately, their boat was caught by the
    return-current, struck by the falling water, and was
    immediately upset. Their perilous position was at once seen
    from the shore, and aid was hurried to their relief, but
    before it could reach them both had perished. Efforts to
    restore your son's life, though long continued, were
    unavailing. Mr. Birely's body was not found until next
    morning. Their remains were, yesterday, Sunday, conveyed to
    the Episcopal church in this city, where the sacred ceremonies
    for the dead were performed by the Reverend Dr. Pendleton, who
    nineteen years ago, at the far-off home of their infancy,
    placed upon them their baptismal vows. After the service a
    long procession of the professors and students of the college,
    the officers and cadets of the Virginia Military Academy, and
    the citizens of Lexington accompanied their bodies to the
    packetboat for Lynchburg, where they were placed in charge of
    Messrs. Wheeler &amp; Baker to convey them to Frederick City.</p>

    <p class="s">With great regard and sincere sympathy, I am,</p>

                                        <p class="close1 s">Most respectfully,</p>

<h3><a name="sympathy" id="sympathy"></a><span class="smcap">Letters of Sympathy in Case of Illness</span></h3>

<p class="b2">When President Alderman, of the University of Virginia, was forced to
take a long rest in the mountains in 1912 because of incipient
tuberculosis, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>late Walter H. Page, at the time editor of the

<em>World's Work</em>, wrote the following tenderly beautiful letter of
sympathy to Mrs. Alderman:</p>

<p class="address1 s">Cathedral Avenue, Garden City, L. I.,</p>
<p class="address2 s">December 9, 1912.</p>

<p class="noi s">My dear Mrs. Alderman:</p>

    <p class="s">In Raleigh the other day I heard a rumor of the sad news that
    your letter brings, which I have just received on my return
    from a week's absence. I had been hoping that it was merely a
    rumor. The first impression I have is thankfulness that it had
    been discovered so soon and that you have acted so promptly.
    On this I build a great hope.</p>

    <p class="s">But underlying every thought and emotion is the sadness of
    it&mdash;that it should have happened to <em>him</em>, now when he has
    done that prodigious task and borne that hard strain and was
    come within sight of a time when, after a period of more
    normal activity, he would in a few years have got the period
    of rest that he has won.&mdash;But these will all come yet; for I
    have never read a braver thing than your letter. That bravery
    on your part and his, together with the knowledge the doctors
    now have, will surely make his recovery certain and, I hope,
    not long delayed. If he keep on as well as he has begun, you
    will, I hope, presently feel as if you were taking a vacation.
    Forget that it is enforced.</p>

    <p class="s">There comes to my mind as I write man after man in my
    acquaintance who have successfully gone through this
    experience and without serious permanent hurt. Some of them
    live here. More of them live in North Carolina or Colorado as
    a precaution. I saw a few years ago a town most of whose
    population of several thousand persons are recovered and
    active, after such an experience. The disease has surely been
    robbed of much of its former terror.</p>

    <p class="s">Your own courage and cheerfulness, with his own, are the best
    physic in the world. Add to these the continuous and sincere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>interest that his thousands of friends feel&mdash;these to keep
    your courage up, if it should ever flag a moment&mdash;and we shall
    all soon have the delight to see and to hear him again&mdash;his
    old self, endeared, if that be possible, by this experience.</p>

    <p class="s">And I pray you, help me (for I am singularly helpless without
    suggestions from you) to be of some little service&mdash;of any
    service that I can. Would he like letters from me? I have
    plenty of time and an eagerness to write them, if they would
    really divert or please him. Books? What does he care most to
    read? I can, of course, find anything in New York. A visit
    some time? It would be a very real pleasure to me. You will
    add to my happiness greatly if you will frankly enable me to
    add even the least to his.</p>

    <p class="s">And now and always give him my love. That is precisely the
    word I mean; for, you know, I have known Mr. Alderman since he
    was graduated, and I have known few men better or cared for
    them more.</p>

    <p class="s">And I cannot thank you earnestly enough for your letter; and I
    shall hope to have word from you often&mdash;if (when you feel
    indisposed to write more) only a few lines.</p>

    <p class="s">How can I serve? Command me without a moment's hesitation.</p>

                                        <p class="close1 s">Most sincerely yours,</p>

    health makes this pleasant weather even seem tiresome and out
    of place. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>I had hoped to find you the same hale and whole man
    I had met in New York a few years ago and now I shall perhaps
    find you bearing a staff all full of pain and trouble. However
    my dear friend as you have sung from <em>within</em> and not from
    <em>without</em> I am sure you will be able to bear whatever comes
    with that beautiful faith and philosophy you have ever given
    us in your great and immortal chants. I am coming to see you
    very soon as you request; but I cannot say to-day or set
    to-morrow for I am in the midst of work and am not altogether
    my own master. But I will come and we will talk it all over
    together. In the meantime, remember that whatever befall you
    you have the perfect love and sympathy of many if not all of

this letter:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

    <p class="s">Please accept this word of sympathy and best wishes. Some
    years ago I had a severe attack of sciatica which kept me in
    bed a good many days: in fact, it kept me in an armchair night
    and day some of the time because I could not lie down, so I
    know what the discomfort and pain are.</p>

    <p class="s">I want to take this opportunity also of sending you my
    congratulations. For I think your leadership has had very much
    to do with the unconditional surrender of Germany. Last Friday
    night I was asked to speak at the Men's Club of the Church of
    the Messiah in this city and they requested me to make you the
    subject of my talk. I told them something about your
    experience in Egypt and Europe in 1910 and said what I most
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>strongly believe, that your address at the Sorbonne&mdash;in
    strengthening the supporters of law and order against red
    Bolshevism&mdash;and your address in Guildhall&mdash;urging the British
    to govern or go&mdash;contributed directly to the success of those
    two governments in this war. If Great Britain had allowed
    Egypt to get out of hand instead of, as an actual result of
    your Guildhall speech, sending Kitchener to strengthen the
    feebleness of Sir Eldon Gorst, the Turks and Germans might
    have succeeded in their invasion and have cut off the Suez
    Canal. So you laid the ground for preparedness not only in
    this country but in France and England.</p>

    <p class="b2">I know it was a disappointment to you not to have an actual
    share in the fighting but I think you did a greater piece of
    work in preparing the battleground and the battle spirit.</p>

<p>The letter of congratulation must be natural, not stilted, and must be
sincere. In congratulating a new acquaintance on a marriage it is not
necessary to send more than the visiting card with "heartiest
congratulations." To a bride and groom together a telegram of
congratulation may be sent on the day of the wedding, as soon as
possible after the ceremony.</p>

<p>To a bride one does not send congratulations, but "the best of good
wishes." The congratulations are for the groom.</p>

<p class="b2">The following letters will serve as examples for congratulatory letters
for different occasions:</p>

<p class="b2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>On the subject of engagements, perhaps the following letter
from Charles Lamb to Fanny Kelly, and her reply, will be of
interest&mdash;though the unarduous and somewhat prosaic tone of
Elia's proposal of marriage&mdash;beautifully expressed as it
is&mdash;is hardly to be recommended as a model calculated to
bring about the desired result!</p>

<p class="noi s">Dear Miss Kelly:</p>

    <p class="s">We had the pleasure, <em>pain</em> I might better call it, of seeing
    you last night in the new play. It was a most consummate piece
    of acting, but what a task for you to undergo! At a time when
    your heart is sore from real sorrow it has given rise to a
    train of thinking, which I cannot suppress.</p>

<p class="s">
    Would to God you were released from this way of life; that
    you could bring your mind to consent to take your lot with us,
    and throw off forever the whole burden of your profession. I
    neither expect nor wish you to take notice of this which I am
    writing, in your present over occupied and hurried state&mdash;but
    to think of it at your leisure. I have quite income enough, if
    that were all, to justify for me making such a proposal, with
    what I may call even a handsome provision for my survivor.
    What you possess of your own would naturally be appropriated
    to those, for whose sakes chiefly you have made so many hard
    sacrifices. I am not so foolish as not to know that I am a
    most unworthy match for such a one as you, but you have for
    years been a principal object in my mind. In many a sweet
    assumed character I have learned to love you, but simply as F.
    M. Kelly I love you better than them all. Can you quit these
    shadows of existence, and come and be a reality to us? Can you
    leave off harassing yourself to please a thankless multitude,
    who know <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>nothing of you, and begin at last to live to yourself
    and your friends?</p>

    <p class="s">As plainly and frankly as I have seen you give or refuse
    assent in some feigned scene, so frankly do me the justice to
    answer me. It is impossible I should feel injured or aggrieved
    by your telling me at once, that the proposal does not suit
    you. It is impossible that I should ever think of molesting
    you with idle importunity and prosecution after your mind [is]
    once firmly spoken&mdash;but happier, far happier, could I have
    leave to hope a time might come, when our friends might be
    your friends; our interests yours; our book knowledge, if in
    that inconsiderable particular we have any like advantage,
    might impart something to you, which you would every day have
    it in your power ten thousand fold to repay by the added
    cheerfulness and joy which you could not fail to bring as a
    dowry into whatever family should have the honor and happiness
    of receiving <em>you</em>, the most welcome accession that could be
    made to it.</p>

    <p class="s">In haste, but with entire respect and deepest affection, I
    subscribe myself</p>

<p class="noi b2">To this letter Miss Kelly replied:</p>

    <p class="address1 s">Henrietta Street, July 20, 1819.</p>

    <p class="s">An early and deeply rooted attachment has fixed my heart on
    one from whom no worldly prospect can well induce me to
    withdraw it, but while I thus <em>frankly</em> and decidedly decline
    your proposal, believe me, I am not insensible to the high
    honour which the preference of such a mind as yours confers
    upon me&mdash;let me, however, hope that all thought upon this
    subject will end with this letter, and that you will
    henceforth encourage no other sentiment towards me than esteem
    in my private character and a continuance of that approbation
    of my humble talents which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>you have already expressed so much
    and so often to my advantage and gratification.</p>

<h3><a name="intro" id="intro"></a><span class="smcap">Letters of Introduction</span></h3>

<p>Letters of introduction should not be given indiscriminately. If the
giver of the letter feels that something of benefit may come to both of
the persons concerned, then there is no doubt about the advisability of
it. But a letter of introduction should not be given to get rid of the
person who asks for it.</p>

<p>It is not good form to ask for one. If it is really necessary to have
one and the friend to be requested knows that you need it, he will
probably give you the letter unsolicited.</p>

<p>A letter of introduction should not be sealed by the person giving it.
It is written in social form and placed in an unsealed envelope
addressed to the person to whom the introduction is made. If the letter
is a friendly letter, it is enclosed in an additional envelope by the
person who requested the letter, sealed, and with his card on which
appears his city address, sent to the person addressed. The person
addressed, upon the receipt of the letter, calls within three days upon
the person who is introduced.</p>

<p>It has been customary to deliver a business letter of introduction in
person, but on consideration, it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>would seem that this is not the wisest
course. The letters of introduction most in demand are those to very
busy men&mdash;men of affairs. If one calls personally at the office of such
a man, the chance of seeing him on the occasion of presenting the letter
is slight. And, as has often been proved in practice, a telephone call
to arrange an appointment seldom gets through. The best plan seems to be
to mail the letter with a short note explaining the circumstances under
which it was written.</p>

<p>Sometimes (more often in business) an introduction is made by a visiting
card with "Introducing Mr. Halliday" written at the top. This method may
be used with a person with whom we are not well acquainted. This
introductory card is usually presented in person, but what has been said
concerning the letter applies here also.</p>

<p class="b2">Matters of a personal or private nature should not appear in letters of
introduction.</p>

     <p class="s">This is the first opportunity I have had to thank you for your
    wonderful gift. But, as you know, our arrangements were
    changed at the last moment and many of our wedding gifts we
    did not have time to open before going away. So we hope you
    will forgive us for the delay.</p>

     <p class="s">We are now back in town established in our new home and I want
    you to know how appropriate are those exquisite candlesticks.
    Mr. Duncan and I are both deeply grateful for your thought
    of us.</p>

<p class="s">
    It is a noble gift, and bears the charms to make it a

    as of a rivule issuing from under low eaves of the woods&mdash;so I
    remember her. You have doubtless other sketches of a maid
    predestined to be heroine. I could take her for one. All the

    and fruit of more reviewing and discussion. I shall keep my

    come out just as it is: I am not sure but that it will in the

    be repaid. It is the kind of book that if it can once get out
    here will sell. The English groan for something better than
    the perpetual r&eacute;chauff&eacute; of their literature. I have not been
    in London for some little time and have not yet had time to
    consult others about the matter. I shall be able to write you
    more satisfactorily a little later. I hear that you have
    written something in <em>The Galaxy</em>. Pray tell O'Connor I shall
    look to him to send me such things. I can't take all American

    very ill with an attack of hemorrhage from the lung&mdash;brought
    on while I was riding a pulling horse at a time when I was

    <p class="noi s">My dear Friend:</p>

    <p class="s">How strange! How strange! As soon as I was able to transfer
    myself to a cooler clime (for in Turin the thermometer stood
    at 31 day after day) I intended to write you a nice letter of
    thanks. A pious intention, wasn't it? But who could have
    guessed that I was not only going back to a cooler clime, but
    into the <em>most ghastly</em> weather, weather that threatened to
    shatter my health! Winter and summer in senseless alternation;
    twenty-six avalanches in the thaw; and now we have just had
    eight days of rain with the sky almost always grey&mdash;this is
    enough to account for my profound nervous exhaustion, together
    with the return of my old ailments. I don't think I can ever
    remember having had worse weather, and this in my Sils-Maria,
    whither I always fly in order to escape bad weather. Is it to
    be wondered at that even the parson here is acquiring the
    habit of swearing? From time to time in conversation his
    speech halts, and then he always swallows a curse. A few days
    ago, just as he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>was coming out of the snow-covered church, he
    thrashed his dog and exclaimed: "The confounded cur spoiled

    Your 'phone call surely caught me napping; but after an hour

    <p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>First, catch your shrimp! When they have been cleaned and
    prepared as for a salad, place on ice and <em>in</em> ice, if
    possible. Grate the carrots on the coarse side of the grater,
    placing immediately on the salad plates, which of course have
    already been garnished with lettuce leaves. Then add just a
    fine sprinkling of chopped apples (I find this the best
    substitute for alligator pears) and then the shrimps. Pour
    over this the mayonnaise and serve at once.</p>

<p class="b2">It may be of passing interest to read a letter or two from distinguished
persons to their boyhood friends. Here is one<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from the late John Burroughs:</p>

                                        <p class="address1 s">Esopus, N. Y., June 1, 1883.</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Tom Brown:</p>

    <p class="s">I have been a-fishing or I should have answered your letter
    before. I always go a-fishing about this time of year, after
    speckled trout, and I always catch some, too. But dog-fighting
    I have nothing to do with, unless it be to help some little
    dog whip some saucy big cur. Game birds are all right in their
    season, but I seldom hunt them. Yet this is about the best way
    to study them.</p>

    <p class="s">You want to know how I felt as a boy. Very much as I do now,
    only more so. I loved fishing, and tramping, and swimming more
    than I do these late years. But I had not so tender a heart. I
    was not so merciful to the birds and animals as I am now.</p>

<p class="s">Much of what I have put in my books was gathered while a boy
    on the farm. I am interested in what you tell me of your Band
    of Mercy, and should like much to see you all, and all the
    autographs in that pink covered book. Well, youth is the time
    to cultivate habits of mercy, and all other good habits. The
    bees will soon be storing their clover honey, and I trust you
    boys <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>and girls are laying away that which will by and by prove
    choicest possessions.</p>

                                        <p class="close1 s">Sincerely your friend,</p>
                                          <p class="close2 b2 s">John Burroughs.</p>

<p class="b2">The following letter<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was written when J. J. Hill&mdash;perhaps the
greatest railroading genius America has ever produced&mdash;was twenty years
of age. It is one of the few letters written by him at this time of his
life that have been preserved:</p>

                                  <p class="address1 s">Saint Paul, February 11, 1858.</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear William:</p>

<p class="s">Your epistle bearing date of seventeenth ult. came to hand on
    good time and your fertile imagination can scarcely conceive
    what an amount of pleasure I derived from it, as it was the
    first epistle of William to James at St. Paul for a "long
    back." My surprise at receiving your letter was only surpassed
    by my surprise at not receiving one from you after you left
    St. Paul, or sometime during the ensuing season. Still, a good
    thing is never too late or "done too often." It gave me much
    pleasure to hear that you were all well and enjoying
    yourselves in the good and pious (as I learn) little town of
    Rockwood. I did intend to go to Canada this winter, but it is
    such a long winter trip I thought I should defer it until
    summer, when I hope to be able to get away, as I intend to go
    on the river this summer if all goes as well as I expect.
    Capt. W. F. Davidson wrote me from Cincinnati about going with
    him as first clerk on the side-wheel packet <em>Frank Steele</em>, a
    new boat about the size of the <em>War Eagle</em>. The Captain is
    Letter A, No. 1, and I think I shall go with him. If not, I
    have two or three good offers for coming season on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>levee,
    besides my present berth, which is nevertheless very
    comfortable.</p>

    <p class="s">I think it mighty strange that some (of my letters) have not
    reached home as I wrote several times to my brother Alex. and
    I never was more surprised in my life than when old Bass
    handed me a letter of inquiry as to my whereabouts. But after
    the boats stop running our mails are carried so irregularly
    that whole bags of mail matter are often mislaid at way
    stations for weeks and some finally lost or otherwise
    destroyed. On the tenth of November last I was returning from
    the Winslow House with Charley Coffin, Clerk of the <em>War
    Eagle</em>, about eleven o'clock, and when we were coming down
    Fourth Street passing one of those rum holes, two Irishmen,
    red mouths, came out and, following us, asked us if we would
    not go back and take a drink. Charley said "no," and we were
    passing on when two more met us who, along with the other two,
    insisted that they meant no harm and that we should go in and
    drink. I told them that I did not drink and that, generally
    speaking, I knew what I was about. We attempted to go on, but
    they tried to have us go back, so I hauled off and planted
    one, two in Paddie's grub grinder, and knocked him off the
    sidewalk about eight feet. The remainder pitched in and
    Charley got his arm cut open and I got a button hole cut
    through my left side right below the ribs. The city police
    came to the noise and arrested three of them on the spot and
    the other next day and they turned out to be Chicago Star
    Cleaners, a name given to midnight ruffians. I was not
    compelled to keep my bed, but it was some two months before I
    was quite recovered from the effects of the cut.</p>

<p class="s">One day on the levee I was going aboard one of the boats and
    slipped on the gang plank and sprained my knee, which laid me
    up for about two weeks. About a week ago my pugnacious friend
    who gave me his mark escaped from the penitentiary at
    Stillwater, along with all the rest of the prisoners confined
    at the time. I am sincerely very grateful to you for your
    generous offer in your letter and fully appreciate your
    kindness. But <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>notwithstanding my bad luck I have still "a shot
    in the locker," about $200, which will put me out of any
    trouble until spring.</p>

    <p class="s">Our winter here has been very mild and open. We have scarcely
    had any snow, but what was altogether unprecedented, rain
    storms lasting three or four days in succession. Times have
    been mighty dull here this winter and money scarce. Write to
    me as soon as you receive this and give me a bird's eye view
    of Rockwood and its inhabitants. Believe me</p>

                                        <p class="close1 s">Yours sincerely,</p>

                                          <p class="close2a s">J. J. Hill.</p>

<h2><a name="personal" id="personal"></a>PERSONAL BUSINESS LETTERS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> does not have to be in business in order to write "business
letters." A thousand personal affairs crop up which require letters of a
commercial rather than a social nature. There is only one rule&mdash;say what
you have to say clearly and quickly. Although the letter should be
written on the ordinary social stationery and follow the placing and
spacing of the social letter, no time should be wasted in trying to make
the letter appear friendly and chatty. The clerks in business houses who
usually attend to the mail seem to be picked for their obtuseness, and
do not often understand a letter which is phrased in other than
commonplace terms. Once I overheard a conversation between an Italian
shoemaker and a Boston woman over the repairing of a pair of shoes. The
woman wanted the soles fastened on with nails. The only word she knew
for that operation was "tapped." The only word the shoemaker knew was
"nailed." They were absolutely at a deadlock until the shoemaker,
knowing that the woman did not want the soles sewed on, proceeded to
demonstrate with hammer and nail just what he meant by "nailed." It is
well to remember that motion pictures do not accompany letters and hence
to take for granted that if a way exists for getting what you mean
wrong that way will be found. It is unfortunately safe to take for
granted that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>a personal business letter is going to be read by a moron.</p>

<h2><a name="business" id="business"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2>THE BUSINESS LETTER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A reporter</span> was sent out on a big story&mdash;one of the biggest that had
broken in many a day. He came back into the office about eight o'clock
all afire with his story. He was going to make a reputation on the
writing of it. He wanted to start off with a smashing first
paragraph&mdash;the kind of lead that could not help being read. He knew just
what he was going to say; the first half-dozen lines fairly wrote
themselves on the typewriter. Then he read them over. They did not seem
quite so clever and compelling as he had thought. He pulled the sheet
out and started another. By half-past ten he was in the midst of a sea
of copy paper&mdash;but he had not yet attained a first paragraph.</p>

<p>The City Editor&mdash;one of the famous old <em>Sun</em> school&mdash;grew anxious. The
paper could not wait until inspiration had matured. He walked quietly
over to the young man and touching him on the shoulder he said:</p>

<p>"Just one little word after another, son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p><p>And that is a good thought to carry into the composition of a business
or any other kind of letter. The letter is written to convey some sort
of idea. It will not perfectly convey the idea. Words have their
limitations. It will not invariably produce upon the reader the effect
that the writer desires. You may have heard of "irresistible"
letters&mdash;sales letters that would sell electric fans to Esquimaux or ice
skates to Hawaiians, collection letters that make the thickest skinned
debtor remit by return mail, and other kinds of resultful, masterful
letters that pierce to the very soul. There may be such letters. I doubt
it. And certainly it is not worth while trying to concoct them. They are
the outpourings of genius. The average letter writer, trying to be a
genius, deludes only himself&mdash;he just becomes queer, he takes to unusual
words, constructions, and arrangements. He puts style before thought&mdash;he
thinks that the way he writes is more important than what he writes. The
writer of the business letter does well to avoid "cleverness"&mdash;to avoid
it as a frightful and devastating disease.</p>

<p>The purpose of a business letter is to convey a thought that will lead
to some kind of action&mdash;immediately or remotely. Therefore there are
only two rules of importance in the composition of the business letter.</p>

<p>The first is: Know what you want to say.</p>

<p>The second is: Say it.</p>

<p>And the saying is not a complicated affair&mdash;it is a matter of "one
little word after another."</p>

<p>Business letters may be divided into two general classes:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>(1) Where it is assumed that the recipient will want to read the letter,</p>

<p>(2) Where it is assumed that the recipient will not want to read the letter.</p>

<p>The first class comprises the ordinary run of business correspondence.
If I write to John Smith asking him for the price of a certain kind of
chair, Smith can assume in his reply that I really want that information
and hence he will give it to me courteously and concisely with whatever
comment on the side may seem necessary, as, for instance, the fact that
this particular type of chair is not one that Smith would care to
recommend and that Style X, costing $12.00, would be better.</p>

<p>The ordinary business letter is either too wordy or too curt; it either
loses the subject in a mass of words or loses the reader by offensive
abruptness. Some letters gush upon the most ordinary of subjects; they
are interspersed with friendly ejaculations such as "Now, my dear Mr.
Jones," and give the impression that if one ever got face to face with
the writer he would effervesce all over one's necktie. Many a man takes
a page to say what ought to be said in four lines. On the other hand,
there are letter writers so uncouth in the handling of words that they
seem rude when really they only want to be brief. The only cure for a
writer of this sort is for him to spend some months with any good
English composition book trying to learn the language.</p>

<p>The second class of letters&mdash;those in which it is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>presumed that the
recipient will not want to read&mdash;comprises all the circular letters.
These are selling or announcement letters and it is hoped that they will
play the part of a personal representative. The great bulk of these
letters are sales letters. Their characteristic is that the writer and
the reader are unknown to each other. It is not quite accurate to say
that the reader will never want to read the letters&mdash;no one knows how
many of the millions of circular letters sent out are read. A farmer
will read practically every letter that comes to him; many business men
will throw every circular letter into the waste basket unread. It is
well to assume in this kind of letter, however, that the recipient does
not want to read it but that he will open and glance at it. It is up to
you to make such a good letter that the first glance will cause him to
read more.</p>

<p>There is no way of catching the man who throws letters away unopened;
any attempt to have the envelope tell what the letter should tell is apt
to be unfortunate, because it will have no effect upon the inveterate
tosser away and may deter even some of those who commonly do open
circular mail. The best method is to make the letter look so much like a
routine business letter that no one will dare to throw it away without
investigation.</p>

<p>The cost of a sales letter is not to be reckoned otherwise than by
results. The merit of a sales letter is to be judged solely by the
results. Therefore it is not a question of what kind of letter one
thinks <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>ought to produce results. The single question is what kind of
letter does produce results.</p>

<p>There is only one way to ascertain results, and that is by test. No
considerable expenditure in direct mail solicitation and no form letter
should be extensively used without an elaborate series of tests.
Otherwise the money may be thrown away. The extent of the tests will
depend upon the contemplated expenditure. Every concern that sends out
many sales letters keeps a careful record of results. These records show
the letter itself, the kind of envelope, the typing, the signature, and
the kind of list to which it has been sent. Thus a considerable fund of
information is obtained for future use. This information, however, has
to be very carefully handled because it may easily become
misinformation, for we cannot forget the appeal of the product itself.
No one as yet has ever been able to gauge in advance the appeal of a
product.</p>

<p>Some apparently very bad letters have sold very good products. Some
apparently very good letters have quite failed to sell what turned out
to be bad products. Therefore, the information that is obtained in the
circularizing and sale of one product has to be taken warily when
applied to another product. It should be taken only for what it is
worth, and that is as a general guide.</p>

<span class="caption">Specimens of business letterheads<br /><a href="#illus">Back to list of illustration</a></span>
</div>


<p>Several concerns with a mind for statistical information have in
the past so carefully compiled the effectiveness of their letters,
but without regard to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the product, that they have discovered an
inordinately large number of things that cannot be done and extremely
few things that can be done. This is the danger of placing too much
faith in previous experience. One of these companies entirely discarded
its records of what could not be done and started afresh. They found
that several of the methods which they had previously used and
discarded happened to do well under changed conditions and with
different products.</p>

<p>If any large expenditure be contemplated then many tests should be made.
The kind of envelope, the manner of addressing, the one cent as opposed
to the two-cent stamp, the kind of letterhead, the comparative merits
of printing, multigraphing, or electric typewriting, the length and
composition of the letter, the effect of the return card, the effect of
enclosing a stamped return card or a stamped return envelope, the method
of signing, and so on, through each detail, must be tried out. No test
is ever conclusive, but very little information of value is to be
obtained by circularizing less than five hundred names. These names may
be taken sectionally or at random. The sectional method is somewhat
better, for then comparison of results in several sections may be made,
and it may turn out that it would be well to phrase differently letters
for different sections.</p>

<p>The returns on the letters are not of themselves conclusive. If one
section responds and another does not, it is well to look into business
conditions in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>sections. It may be that in one section the people
are working and that in another there is considerable unemployment. The
main point about all of these statistics is to be sure that what one
terms results are results, bearing in mind that it is the test and not
what one thinks about a letter that counts.</p>

<p>It is distinctly harmful for any one to say that a letter should be long
or short. It all depends on who is going to get the letter. The tendency
in recent years has been toward the very long sales letter. This is
because in a large number of cases the long letter has been singularly
effective. However, the long letter can be overdone. It is the test
that counts.</p>

<p>The exact purpose for which a letter is written is to be stated clearly
before entering upon the composition. Very few letters will sell
articles costing as much as fifty dollars unless perhaps the payments
are on the installment plan. Many men of experience put the limit as low
as five dollars. Others put it as high as one hundred dollars. It is
safe to say that the effectiveness of a letter which is designed to
achieve a sale decreases as the price of that which is offered for
sale increases. Therefore, most of the letters written concerning more
expensive articles are not intended to effect sales. They are designed
to bring responses that will furnish leads for salesmen.</p>

<p>Other letters are more in the nature of announcements, by which it is
hoped prospects may be brought into a store.</p>

<p>Where the article offered for sale is quite high in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>price, the letters
sometimes may be very expensively prepared. On one occasion the late
John H. Patterson, discovering that his salesmen could not get to the
heads of several department stores, ordered some very fine leather
portfolios. On each portfolio he had stamped the name of the man who was
to receive it. They were gifts such as any one would welcome and which
no one could possibly ignore. Inside each portfolio were contained a
letter and a number of photographs showing exactly what he desired to
have the agents demonstrate. Each gift cost about fifty dollars. He sent
the portfolios with his compliments. The secretaries of the men that he
wanted to interest could not possibly toss them away. They simply had
to give them to their principals. My impression is that the entire
expenditure ran to several thousand dollars, but as a result some two
hundred thousand dollars in sales were effected, for in practically
every case the photographs awakened an interest that led to an
appointment with the salesman.</p>

<p>The following letters are intended to be suggestive. They cannot
honestly be put forward as being more than that. They are all letters
that have gained results under certain circumstances. That they will
gain results under new and different circumstances is a matter on which
no one can speak with any assurance. Every sales letter is a matter of
cut and try. Some of these letters may produce results exactly as they
stand. Others may better be used in combination.</p>

Whether the letter should have a return card or envelope depends upon
circumstances, as also does the inclusion of an illustrated folder. The
return card is more valuable with a letter that goes to a home than with
a letter that goes to an office. Very few men with stenographers will
bother with return cards&mdash;their stenographers or secretaries will send a
note. On the other hand, letter-writing facilities are not so easily
available in the usual home and the card is likely to be used. The
putting in of a folder sometimes takes away from the force of the
letter. It is often better to reserve the folder for a second letter or
for answering an inquiry. For once the prospect has written in for more
information the whole purpose of the letter changes. The interest can be
presumed, and the object of the letter is to give the greatest possible
amount of clear information to the end of causing action. Saying too
much in the first letter may give the reader an opportunity to reach a
conclusion, when the purpose of the first letter is primarily to get a
name&mdash;a prospective purchaser. Many a salesman kills a sale by talking
too much; so does many a sales letter.</p>

    <p class="s">In a couple of weeks you are going to think a good deal about
    your overcoat. Why not start thinking now?</p>

    <p class="s">We are offering this year the most complete line of overcoats
    that we have ever been able to buy. We have found that we
    could buy absolutely first-class coats at absolutely fair
    prices. We are selling them on the basis on which we bought
    them, and we bought a lot because we think the values will
    sell them.</p>

    <p class="s">The prices are surprisingly low. They range from $20 to $70.
    At the lowest price we are selling a coat which, if you saw it
    on the back of a friend, you would think cost at least $50.
    The highest priced coat is as good as money can buy. If you
    expected to spend $50 for a coat, you may find that you can
    get what you want for $20 or $25, or you may find that you
    will want an even better coat than you had expected to buy.</p>

    <p class="s">We think that it would be worth your while to look at this
    stock.</p>

        <p class="s not two">Portland, Me.</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Madam:</p>

    <p class="s">When this store was opened ten years ago, we believed that our
    service would be the most effective if we operated on a credit
    basis. Therefore we solicited charge accounts, of course
    taking extreme care that only people of known integrity and
    substance should be on our books. We have had the privilege of
    serving you through such an account.</p>

<p class="s">There are two fundamental methods of conducting a retail
    business. The one is on the cash and the other is on the
    credit plan. In the cash plan all goods are either paid for at
    the time of purchase or at the time of delivery. In the credit
    plan, those who have not credit or do not care to use credit
    pay cash; those who have credit rating charge their purchases
    and bills are rendered monthly. Credit was not extended by the
    store as a favor; it formed part of a way of doing business.
    The favor is on the part of the customer. The charge system
    has many advantages, principally in the way of permitting the
    store to know its customers better than it could otherwise.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>The disadvantage of the credit basis is the expense of
    bookkeeping which, of course, has to be added into the price
    of the goods sold. Our losses through unpaid bills have been
    negligible. Our customers are honest. But it has seemed unfair
    that the customer who pays cash should have to bear the cost
    of the credit accounts.</p>

    <p class="s">As our business has worked out more than fifty per cent. of
    our whole trade is on the cash basis. After careful
    consideration we have finally decided to go entirely upon a
    cash footing in order that we may further reduce our costs of
    doing business and hence our prices to you. We think that in
    such fashion we can better serve you. Therefore, on July 1st,
    which marks the end of our fiscal year, we shall go upon an
    exclusively cash basis and no longer maintain charge accounts.</p>

    <p class="s">We think that you will agree when you see the savings
    reflected in lower prices for the highest grade of goods that
    the change in policy is a wise one and that you will continue
    to favor us with your patronage.</p>

<h3><a name="sell" id="sell"></a><span class="smcap">Selling Real Estate</span></h3>

<p>There are two phases in the writing of letters concerning the sale of
real estate. The first phase has to do with the presentation of the
proposal in order to arouse sufficient interest in the mind of the
prospect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>to cause him to inspect the property. Comparatively little
real estate is sold without personal inspection. The exceptions are
offerings of low-priced building sites in distant sections of the
country. These are sold sight unseen&mdash;else, as a rule, they would never
be sold at all. But such real estate selling is more apt to be in the
class with fake mining stock than with legitimate buying and selling,
and therefore has no place here.</p>

<p>The second phase of letters on real estate comprehends the closing of
the sale. For instance, let us say that John Hope has gone so far as to
look at a property. He apparently wants to buy the property or is at
least interested, but the price and conditions of sale do not exactly
suit him. He is so situated that he does not want to talk personally
with an agent, or perhaps lives too far away. At any rate, the sale has
to be closed by mail. The fact which most concerns the buyer of real
estate, provided he is otherwise satisfied with a property, is the
title. The title is the legal term by which is denoted the exact
character of the ownership. Quite frequently an owner may believe that
he has a clear title when, as a matter of fact, his title is derived
through some testamentary instrument which gives him a holding only for
life, or perhaps trusts have been set up in the will which are a charge
upon the property, although all of the beneficiaries of the trust have
been long since dead. There are many hundreds of possible legal
complications affecting the validity of the title <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>and it is usual
to-day to have titles insured and, in agreeing to buy, to specify that
the "title must be marketable and insurable by a reputable title
insurance company." The word "marketable" as here used means a title
which is unquestionable. The prospective buyer must also be careful to
specify that the title shall be "free and clear" and that all taxes
shall be apportioned to the day of settlement. Otherwise the buyer would
have to take title subject to a lien of any judgments or other liens of
record and also subject to unpaid taxes.</p>

<p>A real estate transaction may be very complicated indeed, and it is wise
for a buyer to take precautions to the end of seeing that he purchases a
piece of real property rather than a right to a lawsuit. Most letters
offering real estate for sale are written in response to inquiries
generated by an advertisement. The letter offering the property is
designed to bring forth a visit from the inquirer. Therefore only the
information which seems best adapted to bring about that visit should go
into the letter. The temptation is to tell too much, and the danger of
telling too much is that one may inadvertently force a negative
conclusion. It is better to keep down to the bare, although complete,
description rather than to attempt any word painting. The description is
best supplemented by one or several photographs.</p>

<p class="b2">The important points to be summarized are the situation of the house,
the architectural style, the material of which it is constructed, the
number of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>rooms, and the size of the lot, with of course a description
of any stable, garage, or other substantial out-buildings. These are
the elementary points of the description. One may then summarize the
number and size of the rooms, including the bathrooms, laundry, and
kitchen, the closet spaces, fireplaces, the lighting, the roofing, the
floors, the porches, and the decorating. The most effective letter is
always the one that catalogues the features rather than describes them.</p>

    <p class="s">The house is ten years old&mdash;that is, it was built when
    materials and workmanship were first-class. It has been kept
    up by the owner, has never been rented, and is to-day a more
    valuable house than when it was originally constructed. It is
    three stories in height, contains fifteen rooms, four
    bathrooms, breakfast porch, sun porch, children's breakfast
    porch, a laundry, butler's pantry, a storage pantry, and a
    refrigerator pantry. It stands on a plot of ground 150 x 200
    feet, which has been laid out in lawn and gardens, and in fact
    there are several thousand dollars' worth of well-chosen and
    well-placed plants, including many evergreens and
    rhododendrons. The trim of the house, including the floors, is
    hard wood throughout, and the decorations are such that
    nothing whatsoever would have to be done before occupancy.</p>

    any kind of a store that would be benefited by the passing of
    large numbers of people before its show windows. It is located
    at the corner of Third and Main Streets with a frontage of
    thirty feet on Main Street and runs back seventy feet on Third
    Street. There is one large show window on Main Street and two
    on Third Street.</p>

    <p class="s">It is a three-story brick structure, solidly built, and the
    upper floors, if they could not be used for your own purposes,
    will as they stand bring a rental of $200 a month each, and
    with a few changes could probably be leased at a higher
    amount. They are at present leased at the above figures, but
    the leases will expire on January 1st. Both tenants are

    <p class="s">I am glad to get your letter inquiring about my farm. I am
    acting as my own agent because I think it is a farm that will
    sell itself on inspection and I would rather split the
    commission with the buyer than with a middle-man.</p>

    <p class="s">The farmhouse, barns, and dairy are good, substantial frame
    buildings, and they have been well painted every second
    season. There is nothing to be done to them. The house has six
    rooms and a large, dry cellar. The water is soft and there is
    plenty of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>it. The barn is 60 by 50; the poultry house is a big
    one that I built myself. The sheds are all in first-class
    condition.</p>

    <p class="s">This farm contains 240 acres, two miles from Goschen, Ohio,
    and there is a state road leading into town and to the
    railroad. We have rural delivery and telephone. The land is
    high and in first-class cultivation. The orchard has been kept
    up and there are well-established strawberry and asparagus
    beds.</p>

    <p class="s">You will not find a better farm of its kind than this one. I
    have made a living off it for twelve years and anybody else
    can, but the only way for you really to find out what the
    place amounts to is to come down yourself and look it over. If
    you will let me know when you expect to come I will meet you
    at the station in my automobile.</p>

    <p class="s">The price is ten thousand dollars. There is a mortgage of
    $2,500 that can remain, and, other things being satisfactory,
    we can arrange the down payment and the terms for the balance.</p>

<p class="s">
    I enclose a descriptive folder which will give you an idea of
    the grounds that we have for basing our claim that this is the
    most convenient apartment house that has ever been erected.
    The apartments vary in size, as you will see on the plan, and
    for long leases we can arrange any combination of rooms that
    may be desired. These features are common to all of the
    apartments. Every bedroom has a private bathroom. Every living
    and dining room contains an open fireplace, and every
    apartment, no matter what its size, is connected with a
    central kitchen so that service may be had equivalent to that
    of any hotel and at any hour from seven in the morning until
    midnight. There is a complete hotel service, all of which is
    entirely optional with the tenant.</p>

<h3><a name="bank" id="bank"></a><span class="smcap">Bank Letters</span></h3>

<p>The qualities which make a bank popular in a community are, first,
safety; second, intelligence; and third, courtesy. One bank has
potentially nothing more to offer than has another bank, excepting that
of course a very large bank has a greater capacity for making loans than
has a small bank. The amount which by law a bank may lend is definitely
fixed by the resources of the bank.</p>

<p>However, this is not a question of particular concern here, for very
large and important accounts are never gained through letter writing.
The field that can be reached through letters comprises the substantial
householder, the moderate-sized man in business, and the savings
depositor. A bank has no bargains to offer. What a man or a woman
principally asks about a bank is: "Will my money be safe? Will my
affairs be well looked after? Shall I be treated courteously when I go
into the bank?" The answers to these questions should be found in the
conduct of the bank itself.</p>

<p class="b2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>A bank is not a frivolous institution. Therefore its stationery and the
manner of its correspondence should be eminently dignified. It must not
draw comparisons between the service it offers and the service any other
bank offers. It must not make flamboyant statements. Neither may it use
slang, for slang connotes in the minds of many a certain carelessness
that does not make for confidence. Above all, a bank cannot afford to be
entertaining or funny in its soliciting letters. The best bank letter is
usually a short one, and it has been found effective to enclose a
well-designed, well-printed card or folder setting out some of the
services of the bank, its resources, and its officers. Bank solicitation
is very different from any other kind of solicitation.</p>

<p class="s">Some time ago we delivered to you a little home safe for
    savings, and we are writing to learn how you are making out
    with it. Have you saved as much as you had expected? Are you
    waiting to get a certain sum before bringing it in to be
    credited in your passbook?</p>

    <p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>We are often asked if it is necessary to fill a home safe
    before bringing it in to have the contents deposited, and we
    always recommend that the bank be brought in at regular
    intervals, regardless of the amount saved, for you know the
    money begins to earn interest only when it is deposited with
    us.</p>

    <p class="s">We give to small deposits the same careful attention we give
    to large deposits, so we suggest that you bring in and deposit
    whatever you have saved. That will make a start, and once
    started it is truly surprising how quickly a bank account
    rolls up.</p>

    whom you have paid money. It is not only the easy way of
    paying bills but the safe way. You escape all the danger of
    carrying or having in the house more than mere pocket money.
    You will find by opening a checking account with us not only
    the advantages of paying by check but you will also discover
    many conveniences and services which we are able to offer to
    you without any charge whatsoever.</p>

    drafts, and travellers' checks.</p>

    or do not care to manage your own investments, our Trust
    Department will manage them for you and render periodical
    accounts at a very small cost. This service is especially
    valuable because so frequently a busy man fails to keep track
    of conversion privileges and rights to new issues and other
    matters incident to the owning of securities.</p>

    <p class="s">(5) We will advise you, if you like, on the disposition of
    your property by will, and we have experienced and expert
    facilities for the administration of trusts and estates.</p>

     <p class="noi s">Dear Sir:</p>

    <p class="s">May I call to your attention the question which every man of
    property must at some time gravely consider, and that is the
    disposition of his estate after death?</p>

    <p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>I presume that as a prudent man you have duly executed a last
    will and testament, and I presume that it has been drawn with
    competent legal advice. But the execution of the will is only
    the beginning. After your death will come the administration
    of the estate, and it is being more and more recognized that
    it is not the part of wisdom to leave the administration of an
    estate in the hands of an individual.</p>

    <p class="s">It used to be thought that an executor could be qualified by
    friendship or relationship, but unfortunately it has been
    proved through the sad experience of many estates that good
    intentions and integrity do not alone make a good executor.
    Skill and experience also are needed.</p>

    <p class="s">This company maintains a trust department, under the
    supervision of Mr. Thomas G. Shelling, our trust officer, who
    has had many years of experience in the administration of
    estates. Associated with him is a force of specialists who can
    care for any situation, usual or unusual, that may arise. The
    services of these men can be placed at your disposal. I can
    offer to you not only their expert services but also the
    continuity of a great institution.</p>

    <p class="s">Individuals die. Institutions do not die. If you will turn
    over in your mind what may be the situation thirty years hence
    of any individual whom you might presently think of as an
    executor, I believe you will be impressed with the necessity
    for the continuity of service that can be offered only by a
    corporation. In many cases there are personal matters in the
    estate which a testator may believe can best be handled only
    by some of his friends. In such a case it is usual to join the
    individual executors with a corporate executor.</p>

    <p class="s">It would be a privilege to be able to discuss these matters
    with you.</p>

<h3><a name="complaint" id="complaint"></a><span class="smcap">Letters of Complaint and Adjustment</span></h3>

<p class="b2">The letter of complaint is purely a matter of stating exactly what the
trouble is. The letter replying to the complaint is purely an affair of
settling the trouble on a mutually satisfactory basis. The Marshall
Field attitude that "the customer is always right" is the one that it
pays to assume. The customer is by no means always right, but in the
long run the goodwill engendered by this course is worth far more than
the inevitable losses through unfair customers. The big Chicago mail
order houses have been built up on the principle of returning money
without question. Legalistic quibbles have no place in the answer to a
complaint. The customer is rightly or wrongly dissatisfied; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>business is
built only on satisfied customers. Therefore the question is not to
prove who is right but to satisfy the customer. This doctrine has its
limitations, but it is safer to err in the way of doing too much than in
doing too little.</p>

<h3><a name="credit" id="credit"></a><span class="smcap">Credit and Collection Letters</span></h3>

<p>Business is done largely on credit, but comparatively few men in
business seem to understand that in the letters concerning accounts lies
a large opportunity for business building. The old-style credit man
thinks that it is all important to avoid credit losses; he opens an
account suspiciously and he chases delinquent accounts in the fashion
that a dog goes after a cat.</p>

<p>Business is not an affair of simply not losing money: it is an affair of
making money. Many a credit grantor with a perfect record with respect
to losses may be a business killer; he may think that his sole function
is to prevent losses. His real function is to promote business. The best
credit men in the country are rarely those with the smallest percentage
of losses, although it does happen that the man who regards every
customer as an asset to be conserved in the end has very few losses.</p>

<p>Therefore, in credit granting, in credit refusing, and in collection,
the form letter is not to be used without considerable discrimination.
It is inadvisable to strike a personal note, and many firms have found
it advantageous to get quite away from the letter in the first reminders
of overdue accounts. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>They use printed cards so that the recipient will
know that the request is formal and routine.</p>

<p>Another point to avoid is disingenuousness, such as "accounts are opened
for the convenience of customers." That is an untrue statement. They are
opened as a part of a method of doing business and that fact ought
clearly to be recognized. It does not help for good feeling to take the
"favoring" attitude. Every customer is an asset; every prospective
customer is a potential asset. They form part of the good-will of the
concern.</p>

<p class="b2">Tactless credit handling is the most effective way known to dissipate
good-will.</p>

which extreme care should be used for it may happen that the references
have not replied accurately or that there may be somewhere an error.
Many people entitled to credit have never asked for it and therefore
have trouble in giving references. A brusque refusal will certainly
destroy a potential customer and is always to be avoided. The best plan
is to leave the matter open. Then, if the applicant for credit has

    <p class="s">The company first came to us on November 8, 1920. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>On that
    date they purchased from us 50 lawn mowers at a total cost of
    $500. They took advantage of the discount by paying the bill
    on November 18th.</p>

    <p class="s">In January, 1921, they gave us an order for 100 at a total
    cost of $900. This bill they paid in February.</p>

    <p class="s">Their latest purchase from us was in July, 1921. At this time
    their order amounted to 25 lawn mowers. They paid the bill in
    October after we had sent them several requests for
    remittance.</p>

<p>Collection letters may very easily be overdone. The old idea was that
any expense or any threat was justified if it got the money, but among
the more advanced collection departments common sense has crept in, and
it has been ascertained by cost-finding methods that it is not worth
while to pursue a small account beyond a certain point and that when
that point is reached it is economy to drop the matter. How far it is
wise to go in attempting to collect an account is an affair of costs,
unless one has a penchant for throwing good money after bad.</p>

<p>The point to bear in mind in writing a collection letter is that it is a
collection letter&mdash;that it is an effort to get money which is owed. It
would not seem necessary to emphasize so entirely self-evident a point
were it not unfortunately sometimes overlooked and the collection letter
made an academic exercise. There is no excuse for a long series of
collection letters&mdash;say eight or ten of them. After a man has received
three or four letters you can take it for granted that he is beyond
being moved by words. You must then have recourse to some other mode of
reaching him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Drawing on a debtor is also of small use; the kind of a
man who will honor a collection draft would pay his bill anyhow.</p>

<p>If a debtor has assets and there is no dispute concerning the account,
he will usually pay. He may pay because you threaten him, but most
people with the ability to owe money are quite impervious to threats,
and although a threatening letter may seem to bring results, it can
never be the best letter because on the other side of the ledger must be
recorded the loss of the customer. The average writer of a collection
letter usually gets to threatening something or other and quite often
exposes himself to the danger of counter legal action. (See <a href="#chap11">Chapter XI</a>
on The Law of Letters.)</p>

<p>The most successful collection men do not threaten. The best of them
actually promote good-will through their handling of the accounts. The
bully-ragging, long-winded collection letter has no place in
self-respecting business. The so-called statements of collection by
which papers drawn up to resemble writs are sent through the mails, or
served, not only have no place in business but many of them are actually
illegal.</p>

<p class="b2">The letters which are appended have been chosen both for their
effectiveness and their courtesy. They represent the best practice. It
is, by the way, not often wise for the creditor to set out his own need
for money as a reason why the debtor should pay the account. It is true
that the sympathy of the debtor may be aroused, but the tale of misery
may lead him <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>to extend comfort rather than aid. However, several such
letters have been included, not because they are good but because
sometimes they may be used.</p>


<p class="noi"><em>Collection letters</em></p>

<p class="b2">Most firms have adopted a series of collection letters beginning with
the routine card reminder of an overdue account and following with
gradually increasingly personal second, third, fourth, and so on,
letters.</p>

    my ability and then I know you will think me worth more.</p>

    which you ask that the experience of the applicant be set
    forth. I have had no experience whatsoever as a secretary.
    Therefore, although I might have a great deal to learn, I
    should have nothing to unlearn.</p>

    <p class="s">I understand what is expected of a secretary, and I hope that
    I have at least the initial qualifications. I have had a fair
    education, having graduated from Central High School and the
    Crawford Business Academy, and I have done a great deal of
    reading. I am told that I can write a good letter. I know that
    I can take any kind of dictation and that I can transcribe it
    accurately, and I have no difficulty in writing letters from
    skeleton suggestions.</p>


    <p class="s">Your advertisement does not give the particular sort of
    business that you are engaged in, but in the course of my
    reading I have gathered a working knowledge of economics,
    finance, business practice, and geography, some of which might
    be useful. I am writing this letter in spite of the fact that
    you specified that experience was necessary, because one of my
    friends, who is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>secretary to a very well-known corporation
    president, told me that she began in her present place quite
    without experience and found herself helped rather than
    handicapped by the lack of it.</p>

    <p class="s">I am twenty-two years old and I can give you any personal or
    social references that you might care for. I have no ideas
    whatsoever on salary. In fact, it would be premature even to
    think of anything of the kind. What I am most anxious about is
    to have a talk with you.</p>

    <p class="s">Mr. A. C. Brown of the Bronson Company tells me you are in
    immediate need of a sales manager for the Western Illinois
    territory.</p>

    <p class="s">Western Illinois offers a promising opportunity for the sale
    of farm implements and devices. During my experience with the
    Johnson &amp; Jones Company, I got to know the people of this
    section very well, and I know how to approach them. The
    farmers are well-to-do and ready for improvements that will
    better their homes, lands, and stock. There could not be a
    better place to start.</p>


    <p class="s">As Mr. Brown will tell you, I have been with the Bronson
    Company for five years. I started as clerk in the credit
    office, gradually working out into the field&mdash;first as
    investigator, then salesman, and for the last two years as
    sales manager of the Western Virginia territory. The returns
    from this field have increased 100 per cent. since I began.
    With the hearty co&ouml;peration <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>of the men on the road, I have
    built up a system about which I should like to tell you. It
    would work out splendidly selling Defiance Harrows in Western
    Illinois.</p>

    <p class="s">My home is in Joliet and I want to make my headquarters there.
    I have no other reason for quitting the Bronson Company, who
    are very fair as far as salary and advancement are considered.</p>

    <p class="s">My telephone number is Cherry 100. A wire or letter will bring
    me to Columbus to talk with you.</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Sir:</p>

    <p class="s">This letter may be of some concern to you. I am not a man out
    of a job, but have what most men would consider one that is
    first-class. But I want to change, and if you can give me a
    little of your time, I will tell you why and how that fact may
    interest you.</p>

    <p class="s">In a word, I have outgrown my present position. I want to get
    in touch with a business that is wide-awake and progressive;
    one that will permit me to work out, unhampered, my ideas on
    office organization and management&mdash;ideas that are
    well-founded, conservative, and efficient. My present position
    does not give play to initiative.</p>

    <p class="s">If you at this time happen to be looking for a man really to
    manage your office, audit accounts, or take charge of credits,
    my qualifications and business record will show you that I am
    able to act in any or all of these capacities.</p>


    <p class="s">I have written with confidence because I am sure of myself,
    and if I undertake to direct your work, you may be assured
    that it has a big chance of being successful.</p>

    <p class="s">At luncheon last Wednesday you mentioned that you were in need
    of another advertising writer. If the position is still open,
    I should like to recommend Mr. Bruce Walker.</p>

    <p class="s">When I first met Mr. Walker he was with Bellamy, Sears &amp; Co.,
    Boston, and was doing most of their newspaper advertising. His
    work was so good that I offered him a position as advertising
    writer with us. He accepted, with the approval of Bellamy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>Sears &amp; Co., and has been with me for the last three years. He
    has written for us some of the best drawing copy that we ever
    used, and his work has been satisfactory in every way. He is
    original and modern in his advertising ideas, and knows how to
    express them forcefully but without exaggeration. His English
    is perfect.</p>

    <p class="s">I shall greatly regret losing Mr. Walker, but I cannot advance
    him above his present position, and I agree with him that he
    is equal to a bigger position than he has here. I hope you can
    give him the opportunity that he seeks. If you will see him

    plan kitchen and table anywhere. We enclose a menu. Our single
    rooms with private bath are $50, $62, and $70 per week up for
    one person. Rooms without bath, but with hot and cold running
    water and adjacent to bath are $45 per week. Double rooms with
    private bath and furnished with two single beds are $95, $105,
    and $115 per week up for two persons. Rooms for two without bath
    are $80 per week. These rates hold until September 1st.</p>

    <p class="s">The difference in rates is caused by the size and location of
    rooms, but every room is furnished with taste and care. The
    decorations have been carefully thought out. There are no
    undesirable rooms at the Lodge and every room is an outside
    room. Those on the east overlook the 120-acre golf course with
    a magnificent view of the mountains, and those on the west front
    the wooded slopes of Sunset Mountain.</p>

    <p class="s">Stanton affords the greatest combination of scenery, health-giving

    result is perfect.</p>

    lively&mdash;as you will. One of the attractions of the place is its

<h2><a name="form" id="form"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>THE USE OF FORM PARAGRAPHS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A considerable</span> part of the day's run of correspondence in a business
office has to do with not more than half-a-dozen subjects. Quotations
will be asked for. Tenders will be made. Complaints will be made and
received. Adjustments of various kinds will be done, and so on, through
a list that varies with the particular business of the office. It is
advisable to keep the tone of correspondence on a fairly uniform level.
Therefore if each letter has to be individually dictated, only a man
mentally equipped to write letters can do the dictating. The time of
such a man is expensive and often might better be devoted to other
matters. Hence the invention of what is known as a form paragraph, which
is a standardized paragraph that can be used with slight variations as a
section of a great many letters.</p>

<p>The result is that most routine mail does not have to be dictated. A
letter is merely read, the essential facts dictated or noted on the
letter itself, and certain symbols added which tell the stenographer the
form paragraphs that are to be used. The letter is then almost
mechanically produced. Some companies have gone so extensively into the
writing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>of form paragraphs that they have sections covering practically
every subject that can arise. This possibly carrying the idea too far.
Convenience may become inconvenience, and there is of course always the
danger of getting in a slightly unsuitable paragraph which will reveal
to the reader that the letter has not been personally dictated. However,
a certain number of form paragraphs considerably reduces the cost of
letter writing and also conduces to the raising of the standards, for
the mere reading of well-phrased form letters will often induce in an
otherwise poor correspondent a certain regard for clear expression.</p>

<p>The proper form paragraphs that any concern may profitably use are a
matter of specific investigation. The way to get at the list of useful
forms is to take all of the letters received and all of the letters
written during, say, one or two months and then classify them. A number
of letters will have to do with purely individual cases. These letters
should be discarded. They are letters which would have to be personally
dictated in any event and there is no use wasting time composing forms
for them. The remaining letters will fall into divisions, and through
these divisions it will become apparent what points in the
correspondence arise so frequently and in so nearly the same form as to
be capable of being expressed in form paragraphs.</p>

<p>There will probably be a number of subjects which can be covered fully
by two or three form letters, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>a nicer adjustment will usually be
had by thinking of form paragraphs rather than of form letters, for
skillfully drawn and skillfully used form paragraphs will so closely
simulate the personal letter as to leave no doubt in the mind of the
reader that considerable trouble has been taken to put the matter before
him courteously and exactly.</p>

                                        <p class="address1 s">South Boston, Dec. 17, 1890.</p>

    <p class="noi s">Dear Kind Poet,</p>

    <p class="s">This is your birthday; that was the first thought which came
    into my mind when I awoke this morning; and it made me glad
    to think I could write you a letter and tell you how much your
    little friends love their sweet poet and his birthday. This
    evening they are going to entertain their friends with
    readings from your poems and music. I hope the swift winged
    messengers of love will be here to carry some of the sweet
    melody to you, in your little study by the Merrimac. At first
    I was very sorry when I found that the sun had hidden his
    shining face behind dull clouds, but afterwards I thought why
    he did it, and then I was happy. The sun knows that you like
    to see the world covered with beautiful white snow and so he
    kept back all his brightness, and let the little crystals form
    in the sky. When they are ready, they will softly fall and
    tenderly cover every object. Then the sun will appear in all
    his radiance and fill the world with light. If I were with you
    to-day I would give you eighty-three kisses, one for each year
    you have lived. Eighty-three years seems very long to me. Does
    it seem long to you? I wonder how many years there will be in
    eternity. I am afraid I cannot think about so much time. I
    received the letter which you wrote to me last summer, and
    I thank you for it. I am staying in Boston now at the
    Institution for the Blind, but I have not commenced my
    studies yet, because my dearest friend, Mr. Anagnos, wants
    me to rest and play a great deal.</p>

    <p class="s">Teacher is well and sends her kind remembrance to you. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>happy Christmas time is almost here! I can hardly wait for the
    fun to begin! I hope your Christmas Day will be a very happy
    one and that the New Year will be full of brightness and joy
    for you and every one.</p>

<p class="b2">And the distinguished poet's reply:</p>

    <p class="noi s">My dear Young Friend:</p>

    <p class="s">I was very glad to have such a pleasant letter on my birthday. I
    had two or three hundred others and thine was one of the most
    welcome of all. I must tell thee about how the day passed at Oak
    Knoll. Of course the sun did not shine, but we had great open wood
    fires in the rooms, which were all very sweet with roses and other
    flowers, which were sent to me from distant friends; and fruits of
    all kinds from California and other places. Some relatives and
    dear old friends were with me through the day. I do not wonder
    thee thinks eighty-three years a long time, but to me it seems but
    a very little while since I was a boy no older than thee, playing
    on the old farm at Haverhill. I thank thee for all thy good
    wishes, and wish thee as many. I am glad thee is at the
    Institution; it is an excellent place. Give my best regards to
    Miss Sullivan, and with a great deal of love I am</p>

<h2><a name="telegrams" id="telegrams"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h2>TELEGRAMS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the most important thing to guard against in the writing of
telegrams is a choice of words which, when run together, may be read two
ways. As there should be no punctuation (and telegraph companies do not
hold themselves responsible for punctuation) the sentences must be
perfectly clear. There are instances where the use of punctuation has
caused trouble.</p>

<p class="b2">In cases where punctuation is absolutely necessary, as for instance when
more than one subject must be covered in the same message, the word
"stop" is employed to divide the sentences, as:</p>

<p class="s hang2a">Will arrive eight-thirty Wednesday stop telephone Gaines am coming stop will be at Hotel Pennsylvania</p>

<p>Therefore write sentences so that when they are run together there is
only one interpretation.</p>

<p>Use no salutation or complimentary closing. Leave out all words that are
not necessary to the meaning. Omit first-person pronouns where they are
sure to be understood. Do not divide words in a telegram. Compound words
are accepted as one <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>word. Numbers should be spelled out, principally
because it is more likely to insure correct transmission, and secondly
because it costs less. For example, in the ordinal 24th the suffix <em>th</em>
is counted as another word.</p>

<p>The minimum charge for telegrams is the cost of ten words, not counting
the name, address, and signature. Nothing is saved by cutting the
message to less than ten words. There is a certain fixed rate of charge
for every word over ten.</p>

<p>In counting the words, count as one word the following:</p>

<table summary="telegram word count" style="width: 80%;">
<colgroup span="2">

<col width="10%"></col>
<col width="90%"></col>
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td class="tda">I&mdash;</td>
<td class="tdb">Every word in the name of an individual or a concern as:
         Clive and Meyer Co. (four words) DeForest and Washburn Co.
         (four words also, as DeForest is counted as one word).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tda">II&mdash;</td>
<td class="tdb">Every dictionary word. In the case of cablegrams, words of
         over fifteen letters are counted as two words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tda">III&mdash;</td>

<td class="tdb">Every separate letter as the "M" in "George M. Sykes"
         (three words).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tda">IV&mdash;</td>
<td class="tdb">Every figure in a number as 598 (three words).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tda">V&mdash;</td>
<td class="tdb">Names of states, territories, counties, cities, and villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tda">VI&mdash;</td>

<td class="tdb">Weights and measures, decimal points, punctuation marks
         within the sentence.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>To save expense in long messages codes can be used in which one word
stands for several words. The Western Union has an established code&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>private codes can be arranged. Five letters are allowed as one code
word. A word of six or seven letters will thus count as two words.</p>

<p>In cablegrams the use of codes is common on account of the higher rate
for cablegrams. Since the name, address, date, and signature are all
counted, code words are frequently used for the name and address. Code
language is allowed only in the first class of cable messages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Occasional Telegrams</span></h3>

<p class="b2">A graceful, concise, pertinent, and well-worded "occasional" telegram is
frequently not easy to write. The following forms are suggested for the
composition of some of these telegrams. The longer forms can be sent
most cheaply as Night Letters or Day Letters. A Night Letter of fifty
words can be sent for the cost of a ten-word full-rate telegram, i.e.,
from 30 cents to $1.20, depending on the distance. A Day Letter of fifty
words can be sent for one and one half the cost of a ten-word full-rate
message, i.e., from 45 cents to $1.80, depending on the distance.</p>

<h2><a name="law" id="law"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>THE LAW OF LETTERS&mdash;CONTRACT LETTERS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are forty-eight states in this Union, and each of them has its own
laws and courts. In addition we have the Federal Government with its own
laws and courts. In one class of cases, the Federal courts follow the
state laws which govern the particular occasion; in another class of
cases, notably in those involving the interpretation or application of
the United States statutes, the Federal courts follow Federal law. There
is not even a degree of uniformity governing the state laws, and
especially is this true in criminal actions, for crimes are purely
statutory creations.</p>

<p>Therefore it is extremely misleading to give any but the vaguest and
most elementary suggestions on the law which governs letters. To be
clear and specific means inevitably to be misleading. I was talking with
a lawyer friend not long since about general text-books on law which
might be useful to the layman. He was rather a commercially minded
person and he spoke fervently:</p>

<p>"If I wanted to build up a practice and I did not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>care how I did it, I
should select one hundred well-to-do people and see that each of them
got a copy of a compendium of business law. Then I should sit back and
wait for them to come in&mdash;and come in they would, for every mother's son
of them would decide that he had a knowledge of the law and cheerfully
go ahead getting himself into trouble."</p>

<p>Sharpen up a man's knowledge of the law and he is sure to cut himself.
For the law is rarely absolute. Most questions are of mixed fact and
law. Were it otherwise, there would be no occasion for juries, for,
roughly, juries decide facts. The court decides the application of the
law. The layman tends to think that laws are rules, when more often they
are only guides. The cheapest and best way to decide points of law is to
refer them to counsel for decision. Unless a layman will take the time
and the trouble most exhaustively to read works of law and gain
something in the nature of a working legal knowledge, he had best take
for granted that he knows nothing whatsoever of law and refer all legal
matters to counsel.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few principles of general application that may
serve, not in the stead of legal knowledge, but to acquaint one with the
fact that a legal question may be involved, for legal questions by no
means always formally present themselves in barristers' gowns. They
spring up casually and unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Take the whole question of contract. A contract <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>is not of necessity a
formal instrument. A contract is a meeting of minds. If I say to a man:
"Will you cut my lawn for ten dollars?" and he answers, "Yes," as valid
a contract is established as though we had gone to a scrivener and had
covered a folio of parchment with "Whereases" and "Know all men by these
presents" and "Be it therefore" and had wound up with red seals and
ribbons. But of course many legal questions could spring out of this
oral agreement. We might dispute as to what was meant by cutting the
lawn. And then, again, the time element would enter. Was the agreement
that the lawn should be cut the next day, or the next month, or the next
year? Contracts do not have to be in writing. All that the writing does
is to make the proof of the exact contract easier.</p>

<p>If we have the entirety of a contract within the four corners of a sheet
of paper, then we need no further evidence as to the existence of the
contract, although we may be in just as hopeless a mess trying to define
what the words of the contract mean. If we have not a written contract,
we have the bother of introducing oral evidence to show that there was a
contract. Most contracts nowadays are formed by the interchange of
letters, and the general point to remember is that the acceptance must
be in terms of the offer. If X writes saying: "I will sell you twenty
tons of coal at fifteen dollars a ton," and Y replies: "I will take
thirty tons of coal at thirteen dollars a ton," there is no contract,
but merely a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>series of offers. If, however, X ships the thirty tons of
coal, he can hold Y only at thirteen dollars a ton for he has abandoned
his original offer and accepted Y's offer. It can be taken as a general
principle that if an offer be not accepted in its terms and a new
condition be introduced, then the acceptance really becomes an offer,
and if the one who made the original offer goes ahead, it can be assumed
that he has agreed to the modifications of the unresponsive acceptance.
If X writes to Y making an offer, one of the conditions of which is that
it must be accepted within ten days, and Y accepts in fifteen days, then
X can, if he likes, disregard the acceptance, but he can waive his
ten-day time limit and take Y's acceptance as a really binding
agreement.</p>

<p>Another point, sometimes of considerable importance, concerns the time
when a letter takes effect, and this is governed by the question of fact
as to whom the Post Office Department is acting for. If, in making an
offer, I ask for a reply by mail or simply for a reply, I constitute the
mail as my agent, and the acceptor of that offer will be presumed to
have communicated with me at the moment when he consigns his letter to
the mails. He must give the letter into proper custody&mdash;that is, it must
go into the regular and authorized channels for the reception of mail.
That done, it makes no difference whether or not the letter ever reaches
the offerer. It has been delivered to his agent, and delivery to an
agent is delivery to the principal. Therefore, it is wise to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>specify in
an offer that the acceptance has to be actually received.</p>

<p>The law with respect to the agency of the mails varies and turns
principally upon questions of fact.</p>

<p>Letters may, of course, be libelous. The law of libel varies widely
among the several states, and there are also Federal laws as well as
Postal Regulations covering matters which are akin to libel. The answer
to libel is truth, but not always, for sometimes the truth may be spread
with so malicious an intent as to support an action. It is not well to
put into a letter any derogatory or subversive statement that cannot be
fully proved. This becomes of particular importance in answering
inquiries concerning character or credit, but in practically every case
libel is a question of fact.</p>

<p>Another point that arises concerns the property in a letter. Does he who
receives a letter acquire full property in it? May he publish it without
permission? In general he does not acquire full property. Mr. Justice
Story, in a leading case, says:</p>

<p>"The author of any letter or letters, and his representatives, whether
they are literary letters or letters of business, possess the sole and
exclusive copyright therein; and no person, neither those to whom they
are addressed, nor other persons, have any right or authority to publish
the same upon their own account or for their benefit."</p>

<p>But then, again, there are exceptions.</p>

<h2><a name="cost" id="cost"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2>THE COST OF A LETTER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Discovering</span> the exact cost of a letter is by no means an easy affair.
However, approximate figures may always be had and they are extremely
useful. The cost of writing an ordinary letter is quite surprising. Very
few letters can be dictated, transcribed, and mailed at a cost of much
less than twelve cents each. The factors which govern costs are variable
and it is to be borne in mind that the methods for ascertaining costs as
here given represent the least cost and not the real cost&mdash;they simply
tell you "Your letter costs at least this sum." They do not say "Your
letter costs exactly this sum." The cost of a form letter, mailed in
quantities, can be gotten at with considerable accuracy. The cost of
letters dictated by correspondents or by credit departments or other
routine departments is also capable of approximation with fair accuracy,
but the cost of a letter written by an executive can really hardly be
more than guessed at. But in any case a "not-less-than" cost can be had.</p>

<p>In recent years industrial engineers have done a great deal of work in
ascertaining office costs and have devised many useful plans for
lowering them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>These plans mostly go to the saving of stenographers'
time through suitable equipment, better arrangement of supplies, and
specialization of duties. For instance, light, the kind or height of
chair or desk, the tension of the typewriter, the location of the paper
and carbon paper, all tend to make or break the efficiency of the typist
and are cost factors. In offices where a great deal of routine mail is
handled, the writing of the envelopes and the mailing is in the hands of
a separate department of specialists with sealing and stamp affixing
machines. The proper planning of a correspondence department is a
science in itself, and several good books exist on the subject. But all
of this has to do with the routine letter.</p>

<p>When an executive drawing a high salary must write a letter, it is his
time and not the time of the stenographer that counts. He cannot be kept
waiting for a stenographer, and hence it is economy for him to have a
personal secretary even if he does not write enough letters to keep a
single machine busy through more than a fraction of a day. Many busy men
do not dictate letters at all; they have secretaries skilled in letter
writing. In fact, a man whose salary exceeds thirty thousand dollars a
year cannot afford to write a letter excepting on a very important
subject. He will commonly have a secretary who can write the letter
after only a word or two indicating the subject matter. Part of the
qualification of a good secretary is an ability to compose letters which
are characteristic of the principal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>Take first the cost of a circular letter&mdash;one that is sent out in
quantities without any effort to secure a personal effect. The items of
cost are:</p>

    <p>(1) The postage.</p>

    <p>(2) The paper and printing.</p>

    <p>(3) The cost of addressing, sealing, stamping, and mailing.</p>

<p>The third item is the only one that offers any difficulty. Included in
it are first the direct labor&mdash;the wages of the human beings employed;
and, second, the overhead expense. The second item includes the value of
the space occupied by the letter force, the depreciation on the
equipment, and finally the supervision and the executive expense
properly chargeable to the department. Unless an accurate cost system is
in force the third item cannot be accurately calculated. The best that
can be done is to take the salaries of the people actually employed on
the work and guess at the proper charge for the space. The sum of the
three items divided by the number of letters is the cost per letter. It
is not an accurate cost. It will be low rather than high, for probably
the full share of overhead expense will not be charged.</p>

<p>It will be obvious, however, that the place to send out circular letters
is not a room in a high-priced office building, unless the sending is an
occasional rather than a steady practice. Costs in this work are cut by
better planning of the work and facilities, setting work standards,
paying a bonus in excess of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>the standards, and by the introduction of
automatic machinery. The Post Office now permits, under certain
conditions, the use of a machine which prints a stamp that is really a
frank. This is now being used very generally by concerns which have a
heavy outgoing mail. Then there are sealing machines, work conveyors,
and numerous other mechanical and physical arrangements which operate to
reduce the costs. They are useful, however, only if the output be very
large indeed.</p>

<p>The personally dictated letter has these costs:</p>

    <p>(1) The postage.</p>

    <p>(2) The stationery.</p>

   <p> (3) The dictator's time&mdash;both in dictating and signing.</p>

    <p>(4) The stenographer's time.</p>

    <p>(5) The direct overhead expense, which includes the space
        occupied, the supervision, the executive overhead, and
        like items.</p>

<p>The troublesome items here are numbers three and five. If the dictator
is a correspondent then the calculation of how much it costs him to
dictate a letter is his salary plus the overhead on the space that he
occupies, divided by the number of letters that he writes in an average
month. It takes him longer to write a long than a short letter, but
routine letters will average fairly over a period of a month. But an
executive who writes only letters that cannot be written by
correspondents or lower salaried men commonly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>does so many other things
in the course of a day that although his average time of dictation per
letter may be ascertained and a cost gotten at, the figure will not be a
true cost, for the dictation of an important letter comes only after a
consideration of the subject matter which commonly takes much longer
than the actual dictation. And then, again, the higher executive is
usually an erratic letter writer&mdash;he may take two minutes or twenty
minutes over an ordinary ten-line letter. Some men read their letters
very carefully after transcription. The cost of this must also be
reckoned in.</p>

<p>The cost of any letter is therefore a matter of the particular office.
It will vary from six or seven cents for a letter made up of form
paragraphs to three or four dollars for a letter written by a
high-salaried president of a large corporation. A fair average cost for
a personally dictated letter written on good paper is computed by one of
the leading paper manufacturers, after a considerable survey to be:</p>

there will be fewer of them.</p>

<h2>STATIONERY, CRESTS AND MONOGRAMS</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Correspondence</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> all social correspondence use plain sheets of paper, without lines,
of white or cream, or perhaps light gray or a very dull blue. But white
or cream is the safest. Select a good quality. Either a smooth vellum
finish or a rough linen finish is correct. For long letters there is the
large sheet, about five by six and one half inches, or it may be even
larger. There is a somewhat smaller size, about four and one half by
five and one half or six inches for formal notes, and a still smaller
size for a few words of congratulation or condolence. The social note
must be arranged so as to be contained on the first page only.</p>

<p>A man should not, for his social correspondence, use office or hotel
stationery. His social stationery should be of a large size.</p>

<p>Envelopes may be either square or oblong.</p>

<p>In the matter of perfumed stationery, if perfume is used at all, it must
be very delicate. Strong perfumes or perfumes of a pronounced type have
a distinctly unpleasant effect on many people. It is better form to use
none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>An inviolable rule is to use black ink.</p>

<p>The most approved forms of letter and notepaper (although the use of
addressed paper is not at all obligatory and it is perfectly proper to
use plain paper) have the address stamped in Roman or Gothic lettering
at the top of the sheet in the centre or at the right-hand side about
three quarters of an inch from the top. The color used may be black,
white, dark blue, dark green, silver, or gold. Country houses, where
there are frequent visitors, have adopted the custom of placing the
address at the upper right and the telephone, railroad station, and post
office at the left. The address may also appear on the reverse flap of
the envelope.</p>

<p>Crests and monograms are not used when the address is engraved at the
top of a letter sheet. Obviously the crowding of address and crest or
monogram would not be conducive to good appearance in the letter.</p>

<p>A monogram, originally a cipher consisting of a single letter, is a
design of two or more letters intertwined. It is defined as a character
of several letters in one, or made to appear as one. The letters may be
all the letters of a name, or the initial letters of the Christian and
surnames.</p>

<p>Many of the early Greek and Roman coins bear the monograms of rulers or
of the town in which they were struck. The Middle Ages saw the invention
of all sorts of ciphers or monograms, artistic, commercial, and
ecclesiastical. Every great personage had his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>monogram. The merchants
used them, the "merchant's mark" being the merchant's initials mingled
with a private device and almost invariably a cross, as a protection
against disaster or to distinguish their wares from those of Mohammedan
eastern traders. Early printers used monograms, and they serve to
identify early printed books.</p>

<p>A famous monogram is the interlaced "H.D." of Henry II and Diane de
Poitiers. It appeared lavishly upon every building which Henry II
erected. It was also stamped on the bindings in the royal library, with
the bow, the quiver, and the crescent of Diana.</p>

<p>Monograms and crests on stationery, after a period of disuse, seem to be
coming into favor again. The monograms in the best taste are the small
round ones, though very pleasing designs may be had in the diamond,
square, and oblong shapes. They should not be elaborate, and no
brilliant colors should be used. The stamping is best done in black,
white, dark green, dark blue, gold, or silver. The crest or monogram may
be placed in the centre of the sheet or on the left-hand side about
three quarters of an inch from the top. The address may be in the centre
or at the right-hand side. But, as noted above, to use both addressed
and monogrammed or crested paper is not good taste. The best stationery
seems to run simply to addressed paper.</p>

<p>Crests and monograms should not be used on the envelope. In the matter
of crests and heraldic emblems <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>on stationery and announcements, many
families with authentic crests discontinued their use during the war in
an effort to reduce everything to the last word in simplicity. However,
there are many who still use them. The best engravers will not design
crests for families without the right to use them. But the extreme in
"crests" is the crest which does not mean family at all, but is a device
supposed to give an idea of the art or taste of the individual. For
example, a quill or a scroll may be the basis for such a "crest."</p>

<p>Really no good reason exists why, in default of a family with a crest,
one should not decide to be a crest founder. The only point is that the
crest should not pretend to be something it is not&mdash;a hereditary affair.</p>

<p class="b2">On the use of crests in stationery one authority says:</p>

    <p class=" quote s">As to the important question of crests and heraldic emblems in
    our present-day stationery, these are being widely used, but no
    crests are made to order where the family itself has none. Only
    such crests as definitely belong to the family are ever engraved
    on notepaper, cards, or any new style of place cards. Several
    stationers maintain special departments where crests are looked
    up and authenticated and such families as are found in
    Fairbairn's Crests, Burke's Peerage, Almanche de Gotha, the
    Armoire G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, are utilized to help in the establishment of
    the armorial bearing of American families. Of course, the
    College of Heraldry is always available where the American
    family can trace its ancestors to Great Britain.</p>

    <p class="quote s">Many individuals use the coat-of-arms of their mothers, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>according to heraldry they really have no right to do so. The
    woman to-day could use her father's and husband's crests
    together if the crests are properly in pale, that is, if a
    horizontal line be drawn to cut the shield in two&mdash;the husband's
    on the left, the father's on the right. If the son wants to use
    the father's and mother's crest, this must be quartered to
    conform to rule, the arms of the father to be in the first and
    fourth quarter; that of the mother in the second and third
    quarter. The daughter is not supposed to use a coat-of-arms
    except in lozenge form.</p>

    <p class="quote s b2">The dinner card that reflects the most refined and modern type
    of usage is a card of visiting card size, with a coat-of-arms in
    gold and gilt border, on real parchment. These cards are
    hand-lettered and used as place cards for dinner parties.</p>


<p>The use of sealing wax is optional, though a good rule to follow is not
to use it unless it is necessary. The wax may be any dark color on
white, cream, or light gray paper. Black wax is used with mourning
stationery. The best place to stamp a seal is the centre of the flap. It
should not be done at all if it cannot be accomplished neatly. The crest
or monogram should be quickly and firmly impressed into the hot wax.</p>

<p>In selecting stationery it is a good plan to adhere to a single style,
provided of course that a good choice of paper and stamping has been
made. The style will become as characteristic of you as your
handwriting. Distinction can be had in quiet refinement of line and
color.</p>

<p>The use of the typewriter for social correspondence has some
authority&mdash;though most of us will want to keep to the old custom of pen
and ink. In case this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>should be employed for some good reason, the
letter must be placed in the centre of the page with all four margins
left wide. Of course the signature to any typewritten letter must be in
ink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Business Stationery</span></h3>

<p>For the usual type of business letter, a single large sheet of white
paper, unruled, of the standard business size, 8&#189; x 11 inches, is
generally used. The standard envelopes are 6&#189; x 3&#189; inches and 10 x
4&#189;, the former requiring three folds of the letter (one across and
two lengthwise) and the latter requiring two folds (across). The former
size, 6&#189; x 3&#189;, is much preferred. The latter is useful in the case
of bulky enclosures.</p>

<p>Bond of a good quality is probably the best choice. Colored papers,
while attracting attention in a pile of miscellaneous correspondence,
are not in the best taste. Rather have the letter striking for its
excellent typing and arrangement.</p>

<p>Department stores and firms that write a great many letters to women
often employ a notepaper size sheet for these letters. On this much
smaller sheet the elite type makes a better appearance with letters of
this kind.</p>

<p>The letterhead may be printed, engraved, or lithographed, and it is
safest done in black. It should cover considerably less than a quarter
of the page. It contains the name of the firm, the address, and the
business. The addresses of branch houses, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>telephone numbers, cable
addresses, names of officials, and other data may be included. But all
flamboyant, colored advertisements, trade slogans, or advertising matter
extending down the sides of the letter detract from the actual content
of the letter, which it is presumed is the essential part of the
letter.</p>

<p>For personal business letters, that is, for letters not social but
concerning personal affairs not directly connected with his business, a
man often uses a letter sheet partaking more of the nature of social
stationery than of business. This sheet is usually rather smaller than
the standard business size and of heavier quality. The size and shape of
these letter sheets are matters of personal preference&mdash;7 x 10 inches or
8 x 10 inches&mdash;sometimes even as large as the standard 8&#189; x 11 or as
small as 5&#189; x 8&#189; or 6 x 8. The smaller size, however, requires the
double sheet, and the engraving may be done on the fourth page instead
of the first. The inside address in these letters is generally placed at
the end of the letters instead of above the salutation.</p>

<p>Instead of a business letterhead the sheet may have an engraved name and
home or business address without any further business connotations, or
it may be simply an address line.</p>
